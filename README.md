Welcome to Xenify! Our groundbreaking protocol synergistically blends DBXen’s innovative tokenomics and ChainZap’s powerful functionality in one powerful package, setting the stage for a seismic shift in the DeFi landscape. With a maximum total supply of only 21,000,000 XNF tokens, Xenify empowers users to earn XNF by burning XEN or USDy tokens while simultaneously functioning as a first-layer burner for the XEN token. Our overarching mission? To revolutionise the DeFi space with a seamless, ultra-efficient cross-chain swapping experience that lavishes users with native chain rewards and a token with a finite supply.

At the core of Xenify's bold vision is ChainZap, a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. Whether you want to swap tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, or any of the 32 supported chains, Xenify has you covered. With access to 19 different aggregators, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for your swaps. By leveraging cutting-edge APIs, Xenify bridges seamless communication with a wide array of DEX aggregators, dramatically enhancing the swapping experience and streamlining the quest for optimal swap routes across the vast tapestry of chains.

With Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms, a reciprocal environment that benefits all participants is established. XNF stakers are rewarded with a generous 50% of swap fees as native chain rewards across all supported chains. That's right, stakers earn from every swap! The remaining half is strategically distributed towards Xenify's continuous development, marketing, and outreach initiatives. This way, we can raise visibility, spur adoption, and champion sustainable growth, all to the advantage of our users and the protocol itself.

Moreover, Xenify's unique design ensures that a resounding 100% of the burn fees, derived from the burning of XEN and USDy, are routed back to XNF stakers. This strategy encourages user engagement and boosts rewards for those who are deeply engaged with the protocol.

At the heart of Xenify's ethos is a steadfast commitment to fairness and transparency, embodied by our exemplary  token distribution model. There will be no team, founder, or investor allocation. In fact, the only way to mint XNF tokens is through active participation in the ecosystem - by either burning or swapping tokens. This approach certifies a genuinely equitable distribution of XNF tokens, rewarding users for their contributions and fostering a truly community-driven protocol.

As we bring together the cutting-edge liquidity aggregation of ChainZap and our own distinctive tokenomics, Xenify is poised to redefine the landscape of cross-chain swapping, all while nurturing a thriving ecosystem that places utmost importance on user satisfaction and sustainable growth. Join us as we take a leap into the future, and experience the world of Xenify - a realm where innovation meets reward, where community powers expansion, and where the foundation for DeFi's bright tomorrow is being laid. Welcome to the revolution!

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Staking

- Xenify integrates a robust staking rewards mechanism that offers significant benefits to XNF stakers. By staking XNF tokens, users are eligible to receive 50% of the generated swap fees on supported chains as native chain rewards. This makes it extremely enticing for users to hold and stake their XNF tokens. But that’s not all! XNF stakers also receive 100% of the native chain rewards generated from the direct burning of XEN or USDy tokens. This dual-pronged incentive system ensures that active participants in the ecosystem are amply rewarded, helping us foster a vibrant and engaged community.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ♦️ Token Burning

- If users want to acquire XNF tokens, they can do so by burning XEN and USDy tokens. But this is not just a smart move to reduce the circulating supply of XEN and USDy - it is also a powerful way to connect our communities. The burning mechanism has been integrated to not only strengthen the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems but to also strategically align both communities under a shared vision.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

XEN is not your average cryptocurrency. It's the brainchild of the Fair Crypto Foundation, a group dedicated to realizing the original vision of blockchain: mass market adoption. They've sought to lower the entry barrier in the cryptosphere, unlike any other coins currently available. XEN is about making a difference, connecting like-minded individuals, and addressing issues such as overbought and under-recognized cryptocurrencies.

At its heart, XEN is beautifully simple. Based on the ERC20 token standard, it has a minimalistic codebase with zero pre-minting, zero hidden doors, and no admin keys or origin wallets. XEN kicks off with no supply at all and is minted purely by the community's participation. This gives XEN a unique flavor - it starts off as inflationary, then transforms to become disinflationary as the community grows.

What's even cooler is that you don't need to deposit funds to start minting XEN. All you need is an Ethereum-compatible wallet. XEN is a pure, unadulterated digital asset, not propped up by investors or intrinsic value. It's immutable, unchangeable, unstoppable.

Underpinning XEN is a unique Proof of Participation (PoP) system, allowing you, the participant, to mint your own coins. The system of new token distribution is fair and based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. The harder it is to mint XEN, the more valuable it becomes. And as more people jump on board, the total number of XEN drops, making it rarer and more sought after.

Imagine minting your own XEN. You connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet to the XEN smart contract and set the number of days you're willing to wait for your XEN. The smart contract then generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people got there before you. You can stake your XEN for anywhere between 1 and 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1% every 90 days until it stabilizes at 2%. The beauty of it? Your stake's APY is locked in at the time of the stake, based on the number of days since XEN Genesis.

XEN is an exciting experiment in crypto economics, a community-driven initiative that promises to inject a fresh, participatory spirit into the cryptosphere. It's all about democratizing the crypto space, making it accessible to everyone, and letting the community drive its value. It's a brave new world, and XEN is leading the way.

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

USDy is a stablecoin developed by YSL.IO with a focus on sustainability and price stability. The protocol is designed to ensure that USDy liquidity will continue to increase, even in the face of sell pressure. This is achieved through a combination of a Price Stability Model, the ability to create USDy-USDC Treasury-Owned Liquidity autonomously, and an innovative Buyback and Burn feature (UBB) that actively works to stabilize the price of USDy.

During UBB activation, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in on every purchase of YSL using ChainZap. This mechanism uses 100% of the sent USDC to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. This creates a positive feedback loop that increases the demand for YSL, raises the price of USDy, and reduces its supply.

The protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction. As more users join the ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. The UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy-USDC pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy, resulting in a reduction of USDy supply and an increase in price.

The USDy Incentive Buyback (UIB) mechanism stabilizes the price of USDy by incorporating a 25% incentive to purchase YSL and actively reducing the supply of USDy in the process. The UIB performs an automated buyback and burn of USDy from the USDC received for every YSL purchase, and in return, the user receives YSL as well as a 25% bonus in USDy. The UIB is only in effect while the UBB is active and USDy is trading at a maximum of $1.05.

In summary, USDy is a stablecoin developed by YSL.IO with a focus on sustainability, price stability, and liquidity growth. Its unique features, such as UBB and UIB mechanisms, ensure that USDy remains stable and continues to grow in value and liquidity.

The protocol's native token, XNF, with a capped supply of 21.5 million, serves as the primary incentive for users. It rewards them for engaging in various protocol activities, such as burning and swapping tokens. This thoughtful tokenomics design helps foster a robust, community-driven platform where benefits accrue based on users' contributions and involvement.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF, the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, has a capped total supply of 21.5 million. The distribution of XNF is executed through a transparent and equitable model, devoid of pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, and team allocations. This process ensures fairness and inclusivity. Users can earn XNF equity by participating in a range of activities, including burning XEN or USDy tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This token supply model encourages active participation and contributes to a vibrant, community-centric ecosystem.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify employs a unique halving model for its supply distribution. This model applies equally to both direct burns and swap volume distributions. After the 8th halving, the daily distribution rate will stabilize, ensuring a minimum output of 156.25 tokens per day. This approach guarantees an equitable division of the total daily reward pool between direct burns and swap volume, rewarding users who actively participate in burning tokens and engaging within the ecosystem.

The total supply of XNF is capped at 21.5 million, which is divided equally: 10,500,000 XNF tokens are designated for direct burns, and another 10,500,000 XNF tokens are allocated for swap volume. This distribution model, unlike the XEN model that undergoes a 0.2% decrease per cycle, adheres to the halving model. Such a method also ensures a fair distribution of tokens based on users' active contributions, further solidifying Xenify's commitment to fostering an equitable and engaged community.

## ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

Xenify's minting process is structured to reward users who contribute to the protocol's growth by participating in various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, thereby fostering a decentralized and community-driven environment.

Xenify's incentive structure encourages active participation in the protocol's development, fostering a vibrant, decentralized ecosystem. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, thereby motivating further involvement. XNF tokens are distributed through one-day cycles, starting with a reward pool of 20,000 XNF tokens.

The initial 20,000 XNF tokens are divided into two categories: half are allocated to those who burn XEN or USDy tokens, and the other half are reserved for users who contribute to the platform's swap volume. This dual-pronged approach ensures that users are rewarded for both burning tokens and generating swap volume.

The reward pool decreases over time, adhering to a halving model, eventually leading to the full distribution of the 21.5 million XNF tokens. Staked XNF tokens accumulate native token fees (such as ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.) from new XEN or USDy burns or swap fees generated on the Xenify platform. This arrangement incentivizes user participation, promoting platform growth and a vibrant and engaged user base.

### ♦️ Burning 
  - The Xenify ecosystem facilitates the burning of XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF, positioning the XEN burning process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN. This approach does not merely diminish the circulating supply of XEN and USDy tokens, but it also has the potential to enhance their value over time. 

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Swapping 
  - Experience the capabilities of Xenify, a pioneering cross-chain aggregator of aggregators, and enjoy seamless token exchanges on the platform. Your swapping activities contribute to the platform's growth, simultaneously increasing your equity in the protocol through daily XNF token distributions. Furthermore, you benefit from the efficiency and competitive rates offered by aggregated routes across multiple aggregators, which add a layer of convenience to your cross-chain transactions. As such, you're not just a user, but an active participant shaping the future of this dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Staking 
  - Participating in Xenify's growth is made possible by staking your XNF tokens. As a staker, you have the opportunity to earn a proportionate share of burn and swap fees generated within the ecosystem. Exceptional rewards stemming from both burning activities and swap fees across supported chains augment the value of your involvement within the Xenify ecosystem.

  - Xenify's staking model offers users the chance to stake XNF tokens and earn 100% of the burn fees originating from direct burns of XEN or USDy. This opportunity leads to rewards in the form of native chain tokens, a highly liquid asset, promising a potential return on your investment.

  - Xenify's swap fee distribution mechanism is distinctive, allocating an impressive 50% of the platform's swap fees to committed stakers. Staking XNF tokens provides a steady stream of income through native chain rewards. This distribution mechanism not only supports the token's value but also provides additional motivation for stakers, promoting a stable token value and encouraging sustained commitment.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Using the Xenify protocol to swap tokens incurs a fee, primarily aimed at maintaining the rewards pool for XNF stakers. When a user engages in a token swap on Xenify, they are charged a swap fee that amounts to 0.5% of the total swap value. This fee serves a dual purpose: it rewards the XNF stakers for their involvement and investment in the ecosystem, and it supports the ongoing growth and development of the protocol.

The collected 0.5% swap fee is partitioned in a way that promotes balance and incentivization within the ecosystem. Half of the fee, or 0.25%, is distributed to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens, rewarding them for their active participation. The remaining 0.25% is allocated to the Xenify team to fund ongoing operational costs, such as platform development, marketing initiatives, and community outreach efforts.

By paying the swap fee, users not only facilitate their transaction but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle, providing an added benefit for their engagement with the protocol. The portion of the fee dedicated to the team plays a vital role in promoting and enhancing the Xenify platform and the associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF). This ensures heightened awareness and adoption, contributing to the overall growth and success of the Xenify protocol.

## ◽️ Costs of Burning XEN and USDy

Participating in the burning process of XEN or USDy tokens on the Xenify protocol incurs certain costs, including transaction gas fees and a mandatory burn fee. The burn fee structure is designed to offer users discounts based on the number of batches they burn, incentivizing larger burns. The more batches you burn, the greater your discount, which can reach up to 50% off for 10,000 batches. The burn fee is determined using this formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

- $BF$ - Burn fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GS$ - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - The constant 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

<br>

A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either XEN or USDy, set aside for burning. This setup ensures a clear and consistent method for token burning, simplifying the process for users.

To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have at least the Number of Batches multiplied by a fixed number of tokens in their wallet, depending on the token type being burned. The burn fee is directed towards the rewards pool, benefiting XNF token holders based on their stake in XNF. The fee calculation is designed to provide a discount based on the volume of a specific token (XEN or USDy) a user burns, with the maximum discount being 50% for 10,000 batches.

In summary, the burn fee calculation sets the fees a user incurs when they execute a burn operation on Xenify. The fee is determined by multiplying the gas spent on the operation by a factor that accounts for the number of batches being burned. This factor is computed by subtracting the product of the number of batches and 0.00005 from 1, which is then multiplied by the number of batches.

This fee structure encourages users to perform larger burn operations by providing them with progressively lower fees as they increase the number of batches being burned. This approach encourages efficiency and incentivizes users to contribute to the platform, while simultaneously benefiting from reduced fees for larger transactions.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

The protocol establishes a balanced approach for the distribution of XNF tokens. It carefully considers two crucial aspects: the user's active participation in the token burn cycle, and the swap fees they've incurred during the cycle. Both elements are granted equal significance, each accounting for 50% of the total distribution. The user's contribution to the burn cycle is calculated using the following formula:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

In this formula, the total quantity of XNF tokens designated for distribution during a cycle (for instance, 20,000 XNF tokens) is halved and then divided by the sum of batches burned by all participants in that cycle. This results in a value per batch burned. The user's individual contribution is then determined by multiplying this batch value by the number of batches they have specifically burned within that cycle. The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.

<br>

In the swap contribution formula, half of the total cycle distribution is proportionally divided based on the sum total of swap fees contributed by all users in the cycle. This process generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid. The individual user's swap contribution is then determined by multiplying this derived value by the amount of swap fees that the user has individually contributed during the cycle.

The protocol merges the calculated burn contribution and swap contribution to accurately determine the total XNF distribution each user should receive. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

## ◽️ Staking XNF Tokens

Within the protocol, all uncollected XNF tokens are automatically staked. This enables holders of XNF tokens to accrue native chain rewards. By restaking their already collected or unstaked XNF tokens, users can further boost their rewards. Both unclaimed and staked XNF tokens contribute to the accrual of native chain rewards, with each user's proportion determined by their stake in the total native chain reward pool.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Token

Upon the conclusion of each cycle, earned equity is ready for collection. While users can opt to collect their XNF equity from prior cycles, this action is not obligatory. Users may prefer to let their equity remain staked to maximize their native chain rewards or decide to collect it for trading purposes.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

When XNF tokens are staked, they are held securely for two full daily cycles, including during any 'gap cycles'. After the initial cycle, staked tokens start to gather native chain rewards, derived from both the swap fees and burn fees. These fees are gathered into a pool and shared amongst XNF stakers. Once two cycles have elapsed, users can opt to unstake their XNF tokens, thereby reclaiming full ownership. At this juncture, all accumulated native chain rewards are dispersed to the user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Token Rewards

Just like collecting equity, users can claim their accumulated native token rewards by withdrawing all previously earned native tokens. This feature allows users to easily access and manage their rewards, demonstrating Xenify's commitment to a user-friendly experience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

Each cycle sees a pool of native tokens accruing rewards, increasing with every transaction, whether it's a swap or a burn. Swap transactions contribute swap fees to the pool, while burn transactions contribute burn fees. These rewards are subsequently allocated at the end of each cycle, corresponding to the total number of XNF tokens a user has locked within the protocol, including both uncollected and staked tokens. In addition, the XNF tokens obtained from burning XEN or USDy and from swaps during the cycle also contribute to the total rewards. This reward structure emphasizes the benefits of active participation within the protocol.

# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To ensure a smooth and successful start for Xenify, a special liquidity provisioning event will take place during the launch. The distribution of XNF tokens will be adjusted to meet the platform's liquidity needs and support its users across all chains. This well-planned launch guarantees sufficient liquidity is created on each chain, providing a strong foundation for the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: Burn and Liquidity Allocation

On the first day of the event, 20,000 XNF tokens will be allocated. Of these tokens, 10,000 XNF will be designated for liquidity provisioning, to be used for protocol-owned liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF will be made available for the burning, allowing users to participate in a fair and decentralized token distribution. The native chain rewards generated on Day 1 will be utilized for liquidity pairing, with the corresponding LP tokens being burned to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability. The initial price of XNF tokens will be based on the amount of native tokens received against the 10,000 XNF. 

#### ▫️ The formula for the initial price is:

<br>

$$
IP = NT \div TXT
$$

**Where:**

- $IP$ - Initial Price
- $NT$ - Total Value of Native Tokens Collected
- $TXT$ - Total XNF Tokens (10,000)

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution

Starting from Day 2, the distribution of XNF tokens will return to its regular schedule, with 10,000 XNF allocated for the burning of XEN and USDy tokens and another 10,000 XNF designated for swap volume. This balanced distribution model will continue to incentivize users to actively engage with the protocol, contributing to its growth and success while maintaining a fair and sustainable token economy.

<br>

In a bid to encourage active participation and kickstart liquidity creation, an airdrop of 500,000 XNF tokens will be conducted on Day 2. This airdrop is exclusively available to those who take part in swaps and pay the accompanying 0.5% swap fee before the deployment of the XNF contract. From this fee, 0.25% is allocated to the team to finance continual operational expenses, including platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities. The remaining 0.25% will be collected until the deployment, and then distributed as part of the first native reward distribution to users who burn either XEN or USDy tokens on Day 1. This approach not only stimulates early engagement but also helps to establish a solid liquidity pool across all the chains from the very first day.

Introducing the [Phoenix Apes](https://docs.ysl.io/protocol-features/Phoenix-NFT) and [XENFT APEXs](https://faircrypto.org/xenft_litepaper.pdf), exclusive NFT collectibles that bring together the XEN and YSL.IO communities while offering an amplified burn effect for Xenify users who hold either of them. These NFTs not only enhance the burn effect on Xenify but also provide a range of enticing benefits for their holders. By offering these additional perks, the Phoenix Apes and XENFT APEXs elevate the user experience and add significant value to the Xenify ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Limited Collectible

  - The Phoenix Apes are an exclusive NFT collectible with only a 520 total supply. Priced at 2500 USDC, these rare NFTs offer a unique opportunity for collectors and investors who are looking for a valuable and innovative digital asset. On the other hand, XENFT APEX NFTs have a max supply of 10,000 and are based on rarety classes, with the minting price determined by the amount of XEN burned for each NFT. This structure provides additional options and incentives for users who want to participate in the Xenify ecosystem and support its growth through the burning of XEN tokens.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Amplified Burn Effect

  - Holders of either Phoenix Ape NFTs or XENFT APEX NFTs will benefit from an amplified burn effect during the burn process on Xenify. This unique advantage enables NFT holders to enhance the burn effect, effectively doubling their batch burn. For example, if a user burns 1 batch, it will count as 2 batches if they possess an NFT at the time of the burn. This exclusive feature promotes unity between both communities and adds value to the NFT holders.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

  - A portion of the rental income collected as tax, combined with a share of the royalty taxes taken on OpenSea, will be distributed to all Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain as claimable USDC rewards at the end of each 8-hour epoch. However, it is important to note that if the NFT is bridged to another chain to amplify the burns, the holder will not be part of the USDC distribution. The claimable USDC rewards are exclusively for addresses holding the Phoenix Ape NFT on the BNB Chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unique Rental Mechanism
  
  - The Phoenix Ape NFT introduces a one-of-a-kind rental mechanism, allowing you to lease your NFT at a predetermined USDC price for a specific duration while it stays on the BNB Chain. This innovative feature plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the USDy token. By renting out your Phoenix Ape NFT, you contribute to the generation of LP tokens that are utilised in the USDy Incentive Buyback (UIB) mechanism, promoting the token's overall stability and health within the ecosystem. Moreover, Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain receive a portion of the rental tax, further rewarding their participation and investment in holding this exclusive NFT.

Xenify places a strong emphasis on user experience, striving to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear instructions and guidance to help users navigate the platform with ease. Users can interact with the platform through various functions, such as swapping tokens across multiple blockchains, staking, and claiming rewards.

Unlike traditional decentralised exchanges, Xenify does not require users to provide liquidity. Instead, it operates as a cross-chain aggregator, utilising APIs to source the best exchange rates and lowest fees from multiple decentralised exchanges. This approach simplifies the user experience and allows for seamless transactions across different blockchain networks.

The platform provides a seamless experience for claiming rewards, staking, and unstaking tokens. Users can easily monitor their staked assets and accrued rewards, and claim or unstake their tokens with just a few clicks. This user-centric approach ensures that Xenify remains accessible to both novice and experienced users alike.
