Xenify is a pioneering project that merges DBXen's trailblazing tokenomics with ChainZap's potent functionality, striving to redefine the DeFi landscape. With a total supply of 21,000,000 XNF tokens, Xenify allows users to acquire XNF by burning DXN or FENIX tokens, acting as a layer 2 burner of XEN. The primary goal of Xenify is to establish a seamless, efficient cross-chain swapping protocol that rewards users through native chain rewards and its capped supply token.

At the heart of Xenify's vision lies ChainZap, an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. By connecting to 18 different aggregators across leading chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for users. Harnessing the power of advanced APIs, Xenify ensures smooth communication with various liquidity aggregators, significantly enhancing the user swapping experience and streamlining the process of identifying the best swap routes across multiple chains.

Xenify's swap fee implementation is ingeniously designed to serve multiple objectives. Staked XNF holders on supported chains receive 100% of swap fees as native chain rewards, while swap fees from unsupported chains are redirected towards future audits and marketing initiatives for the XenSwap team. This strategic allocation mechanism fosters long-term growth and sustainability for the protocol, benefiting both users and the platform itself.

The protocol's comprehensive reward mechanics establish a robust and attractive incentive system for participants. By providing native chain rewards from swap fees on supported chains and protocol fees generated through the direct burns of DXN or FENIX tokens, Xenify cultivates a thriving ecosystem for staked XNF holders. This multifaceted reward structure not only benefits users but also plays a crucial role in promoting the protocol's long-term growth and sustainability.

By integrating ChainZap's state-of-the-art liquidity aggregation with its unique tokenomics, Xenify paves the way for a new era in DeFi. This comprehensive approach offers a one-stop solution for users navigating the complexities of decentralized finance, ensuring easy access to a wide array of swap routes and a user-centric platform that prioritizes their long-term success and satisfaction.

## ◽️ Token Supply

The XNF token fuels user engagement with the Xenify platform. With a total supply of 21 million XNF, its distribution follows a fair launch model, eliminating pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocation, and team allocations. Users can mint their XNF equity by participating in a variety of activities on the platform, such as burning DXN or FENIX tokens and swapping tokens on supported chains.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify's distribution employs an exciting halving model, applying to both direct burns and swap volume distributions. From the 8th halving onwards, the daily distribution rate will maintain a minimum of 156.25 tokens/day. This approach equally divides the total daily reward pool between direct burns and swap volume, ensuring users are handsomely rewarded for both burning tokens and actively participating in the Xenify ecosystem. The halving schedule guarantees a fair distribution of rewards based on users' contributions to the platform.

To achieve this thrilling distribution, the 21 million XNF total supply is split into two equal parts: 10,500,000 XNF tokens allocated for direct burns and another 10,500,000 XNF tokens designated for swap volume. This distribution deviates from the DXN model, which has a 0.2% decrease per cycle, and instead follows the captivating halving model outlined below:

## ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

Xenify's minting process is designed to provide equity to users who actively participate in various platform activities, contributing to the growth of the ecosystem. The incentive structure ensures a fair and equitable distribution of XNF tokens, promoting a decentralized and community-driven protocol. Users can engage in activities such as burning and swapping.

The incentive structure of Xenify encourages users to actively participate in the platform's growth, driving value and fostering a thriving, decentralized ecosystem. As users engage more with Xenify, they receive a share of the newly minted XNF tokens based on their participation level, motivating them to contribute even more to the platform's success. XNF tokens are distributed through one-day cycles, starting with a reward pool of 20,000 XNF tokens.

The 20,000 XNF tokens are divided into two categories: 10,000 XNF tokens are allocated specifically to those who burn DXN or FENIX tokens, while the other 10,000 XNF tokens are reserved for users contributing to swap volume on the platform. This distribution ensures that users participating in the burning of different tokens and generating swap volume are rewarded accordingly. By providing incentives for users to engage with the platform, Xenify encourages a thriving, community-driven ecosystem that benefits all participants.

The reward pool decreases according to the halving model, leading to the distribution of nearly 21 million XNF tokens over time. Staked XNF tokens accumulate native token fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.) from new DXN or FENIX burns or swap fees generated on the Xenify platform across supported chains. This design incentivizes user participation, helping maintain platform growth and fostering a thriving, community-driven environment.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Swapping tokens on the Xenify protocol involves a swap fee, which contributes to the rewards pool for XNF token holders. When users perform a token swap on Xenify, they are required to pay a swap fee, set at 0.25% of the total swap amount. This fee is aimed at rewarding XNF stakers for their participation in the ecosystem.

The entire 0.25% swap fee is distributed to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens as an incentive for their participation in the ecosystem. Additionally, the swap fee grants stakers a position in the daily cycle of XNF rewards. The team may receive referral incentives from aggregators, which help support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach efforts. These rewards play a crucial role in raising awareness and adoption of XEN, DXN, FENIX, and XNF tokens, ensuring the platform's continued growth and success.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning DXN and FENIX

In order to burn DXN, or FENIX on the Xenify platform, users must pay the transaction gas fee and an additional mandatory Protocol fee. The Protocol fee is calculated as follows:

<br>

$$
Protocol fee = Gas Spent * (1 - 0.00005 * Number of Batches) * Number of Batches
$$

<br>

A batch is a fixed number of tokens to burn, depending on the token being burned (DXN or FENIX).

For example, on Ethereum:

- 1 batch = [Fixed Number] DXN tokens
- 1 batch = [Fixed Number] FENIX tokens

To execute the burn function on the Xenify protocol, users need to have at least the Number of Batches * [Fixed Number of Tokens] in their wallet, depending on the token being burned. The Protocol fee is directed towards the reward pool, from which XNF token holders are rewarded based on their accrued XNF. The fee calculation is designed to apply a discount based on the amount of a specific token (DXN or FENIX) the user burns, with the maximum discount being 50% for 10,000 batches (the larger the number of batches, the bigger the discount).

In essence, the Protocol fee calculation determines the fees charged from a user when they perform a burn operation on the Xenify Protocol. The fee is calculated by multiplying the gas spent on the operation by a factor that takes into account the number of batches being burned. This factor is calculated by subtracting the product of the number of batches and 0.00005 from 1, which is then multiplied by the number of batches.

By structuring the fee calculation this way, Xenify encourages users to perform larger, more efficient burn operations by gradually charging them lower fees as they increase the number of batches being burned. This system promotes efficiency and incentivizes users to contribute to the platform while enjoying the benefits of reduced fees for larger transactions.

<br>

$$
PF = GS (1 − 0.00005 * NB) * NB
$$

<br>

**Notations:**

- **PF** - Protocol fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- **GS** - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- **NB** - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in protocol fees as the number of batches increases.

The constant 0.00005 is used to factor in the discount on the protocol fee.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Reward Cycle Distribution

The "User Reward/Cycle" formula calculates the rewards percentage that a specific user is entitled to receive for their contribution to a burn cycle. The calculation is performed by multiplying the total cycle reward amount by the number of batches the user has burned in that specific cycle and then dividing it by the total number of batches burned in that cycle by all users. This calculation ensures fair and proportionate distribution of rewards to all participants based on their burn contribution.

<br>

$$
URC = TCR × UBN / TBN
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- **URC:** The reward earned by a specific user in a particular cycle.
- **TCR:** The total amount of rewards distributed among all users in a particular cycle.
- **UBN:** The total number of batches a specific user has burned during the cycle.
- **TBN:** The total number of batches burned by all users during the cycle.

The XNF rewards are calculated based on the gas consumed from burning DXN or FENIX. This represents the computational expense of executing the transaction. After the cycle ends, the reward calculated per user for a specific cycle is given by the total amount of gas consumed divided by the amount of gas consumed by a specific user. Rewards are claimable only after the corresponding cycle ends.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Staking XNF tokens

Unclaimed XNF tokens are considered as staked within the protocol. Claimed or unstaked XNF needs to be staked back into the protocol in order to generate the respective rewards. Unclaimed+Staked XNF will generate passive income in the blockchain's native token based on the share from the reward pool entitled to each respective user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF tokens

The staked XNF tokens that have reached the cycle in which they are unlocked can be unstaked, returning them to the user's possession.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Equity (XNF)

Once a cycle ends, the equity associated with it are ready to be claimed. A user claiming their rewards will be granted the entire amount of XNF tokens earned in all previous cycles.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Token Fees

Similar to claiming rewards, a user wishing to claim their accumulated fees will withdraw all the native tokens obtained beforehand.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Fee Distribution

Each cycle has its own pool of accrued native token fees that accumulate while burnBatch transactions are executed. Per cycle, these are distributed based on how many locked XNF tokens a user has inside the protocol (locked - unclaimed XNF + staked XNF) added with how many XNF tokens were gained from burning DXN or FENIX in the corresponding cycle.

<br>

![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)
# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To ensure a smooth and successful start for Xenify, a special liquidity provisioning event will take place during the launch. The distribution of XNF tokens will be adjusted to meet the platform's liquidity needs and support its users across all chains. This well-planned launch guarantees sufficient liquidity is created on each chain, providing a strong foundation for the ecosystem. 

The initial price of XNF tokens will be based on the amount of native tokens received against the 10,000 XNF. For example, if $10,000 worth of ETH is collected, the starting price will be set at $1.00. 

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: Burn and Liquidity Allocation
  - On the first day of the event, 20,000 XNF tokens will be allocated. Of these tokens, 10,000 XNF will be designated for liquidity provisioning, to be used for protocol-owned liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF will be made available for the burning, allowing users to participate in a fair and decentralized token sale. The native chain rewards generated on Day 1 will be utilized for liquidity pairing, with the corresponding LP tokens being burned to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability.

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution
  - Starting from Day 2, the distribution of XNF tokens will return to its regular schedule, with 10,000 XNF allocated for the burning of DXN and FENIX tokens and another 10,000 XNF designated for swap volume. This balanced distribution model will continue to incentivize users to actively engage with the protocol, contributing to its growth and success while maintaining a fair and sustainable token economy.
