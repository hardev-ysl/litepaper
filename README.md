# ◽️ DXN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

## ◽️ Total Supply: 5,010,000

DBXen (DXN) is a groundbreaking digital asset within the XEN ecosystem that contributes to XEN deflation while providing users with new value creation opportunities. The project's primary objective is to ensure a fair and equitable token distribution through a community-driven approach, fostering a decentralized and transparent ecosystem.

The deflationary mechanism of DXN is one of its key features. As a capped token, DXN can only be minted through the burning of XEN tokens, reducing their total supply and addressing inflation concerns. Furthermore, DXN tokens serve as an income stream for stakers, who receive native chain rewards until the entire DXN supply is distributed over approximately 62 years.

DBXen protocol's commitment to a fair launch eliminates pre-mines, treasury allocations, and private/public sales, ensuring equal distribution for all users. This approach, coupled with the pre-programmed token distribution algorithm, guarantees transparency and fairness, as it cannot be altered or reverted once live.

With a total supply capped at around 5.01 million, DXN tokens offer long-term stability and scarcity. The distribution process occurs in one-day cycles, starting with an initial reward pool of 10,000 DXN tokens, which decreases by approximately 0.2% per cycle, promoting a gradual distribution. Moreover, DXN tokens staked within the protocol generate native token rewards each time a new XEN burn occurs, providing an extra incentive for users to participate in the DBXen ecosystem.

In conclusion, DBXen (DXN) aspires to build a sustainable, transparent protocol that benefits the community by addressing inflation and offering staking opportunities. By leveraging the collective power of the Xenian community, DBXen aims to create a more equitable, decentralized, and prosperous digital asset landscape within the XEN ecosystem. This environment empowers users to actively participate and enjoy the rewards of their involvement. With a steadfast commitment to fairness, transparency, and innovation, DBXen is set to make a lasting impact on the XEN ecosystem, contributing to its overall success.

# ◽️ xYSL Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

## ◽️ Total Supply: 80,000

xYSL is a revolutionary hyper-deflationary token engineered to create sustainable value appreciation through its unique tokenomics and autonomous algorithm. The token has been designed to increase in price and scarcity regardless of the market situation, making it an ideal investment for those seeking long-term success in the cryptocurrency space.

The core of xYSL's deflationary mechanics lies in its integration with the USDy token, the reward token of the YSL.IO ecosystem. Every time USDy is sold or transferred, the protocol uses 10% of the USDy transaction to buy xYSL from the market, which is then immediately burned and sent to a dead address. This continuous supply reduction is further supported by a built-in transactional burn that sends 2.5% of every transfer or sell transaction to the dead address.

Furthermore, xYSL's positive feedback loop is bolstered by the growing trading volume of USDy as the ecosystem attracts more participants. This dynamic creates a setting in which xYSL's price continually rises while its supply decreases, making it an increasingly appealing investment opportunity. Investors looking to maximize their earnings can stake xYSL tokens in the AceVault, earning Virtue-Rewards every 8 hours. The vault's perpetual ratio feature also enhances the xYSL balance with each deposit and withdrawal, further contributing to the token's value appreciation.

In summary, xYSL introduces a novel and innovative approach to value appreciation, combining hyper-deflationary mechanics, an autonomous algorithm, and seamless integration with the USDy reward token. This distinctive design makes xYSL an exceptional opportunity for investors seeking long-term success and sustainable growth within the rapidly evolving decentralized digital asset landscape. By leveraging its unique tokenomics and features, xYSL aims to redefine the concept of value preservation and appreciation in the world of cryptocurrencies.

# ◽️ Xenify Tokenomics
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

Xenify's tokenomics structure is designed with fairness, sustainability, and active user participation at its core. The protocol's native token, XNF, with a capped supply of 21 million, serves as the primary incentive for users. It rewards them for engaging in various protocol activities, such as burning and swapping tokens. This thoughtful tokenomics design helps foster a robust, community-driven platform where benefits accrue based on users' contributions and involvement.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Token Supply

XNF, the lifeblood of the Xenify protocol, has a capped total supply of 21 million. The distribution of XNF is executed through a transparent and equitable model, devoid of pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocations, and team allocations. This process ensures fairness and inclusivity. Users can earn XNF equity by participating in a range of activities, including burning DXN or xYSL tokens and swapping tokens across supported chains. This token supply model encourages active participation and contributes to a vibrant, community-centric ecosystem.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify employs a unique halving model for its supply distribution. This model applies equally to both direct burns and swap volume distributions. After the 8th halving, the daily distribution rate will stabilize, ensuring a minimum output of 156.25 tokens per day. This approach guarantees an equitable division of the total daily reward pool between direct burns and swap volume, rewarding users who actively participate in burning tokens and engaging within the ecosystem.

The total supply of XNF is capped at 21 million, which is divided equally: 10,500,000 XNF tokens are designated for direct burns, and another 10,500,000 XNF tokens are allocated for swap volume. This distribution model, unlike the DXN model that undergoes a 0.2% decrease per cycle, adheres to the halving model. Such a method also ensures a fair distribution of tokens based on users' active contributions, further solidifying Xenify's commitment to fostering an equitable and engaged community.

## ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

Xenify's minting process is structured to reward users who contribute to the protocol's growth by participating in various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, thereby fostering a decentralized and community-driven environment.

Xenify's incentive structure encourages active participation in the protocol's development, fostering a vibrant, decentralized ecosystem. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, thereby motivating further involvement. XNF tokens are distributed through one-day cycles, starting with a reward pool of 20,000 XNF tokens.

The initial 20,000 XNF tokens are divided into two categories: half are allocated to those who burn DXN or xYSL tokens, and the other half are reserved for users who contribute to the platform's swap volume. This dual-pronged approach ensures that users are rewarded for both burning tokens and generating swap volume.

The reward pool decreases over time, adhering to a halving model, eventually leading to the full distribution of the 21 million XNF tokens. Staked XNF tokens accumulate native token fees (such as ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.) from new DXN or xYSL burns or swap fees generated on the Xenify platform. This arrangement incentivizes user participation, promoting platform growth and a vibrant and engaged user base.

### ♦️ Burning 
  - The Xenify ecosystem facilitates the burning of DXN and xYSL tokens to mint XNF, positioning the DXN burning process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN. This approach does not merely diminish the circulating supply of DXN and xYSL tokens, but it also has the potential to enhance their value over time. 

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Swapping 
  - Experience the capabilities of Xenify, a pioneering cross-chain aggregator of aggregators, and enjoy seamless token exchanges on the platform. Your swapping activities contribute to the platform's growth, simultaneously increasing your equity in the protocol through daily XNF token distributions. Furthermore, you benefit from the efficiency and competitive rates offered by aggregated routes across multiple aggregators, which add a layer of convenience to your cross-chain transactions. As such, you're not just a user, but an active participant shaping the future of this dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Staking 
  - Participating in Xenify's growth is made possible by staking your XNF tokens. As a staker, you have the opportunity to earn a proportionate share of burn and swap fees generated within the ecosystem. Exceptional rewards stemming from both burning activities and swap fees across supported chains augment the value of your involvement within the Xenify ecosystem.

  - Xenify's staking model offers users the chance to stake XNF tokens and earn 100% of the burn fees originating from direct burns of DXN or xYSL. This opportunity leads to rewards in the form of native chain tokens, a highly liquid asset, promising a potential return on your investment.

  - Xenify's swap fee distribution mechanism is distinctive, allocating an impressive 50% of the platform's swap fees to committed stakers. Staking XNF tokens provides a steady stream of income through native chain rewards. This distribution mechanism not only supports the token's value but also provides additional motivation for stakers, promoting a stable token value and encouraging sustained commitment.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Using the Xenify protocol to swap tokens incurs a fee, primarily aimed at maintaining the rewards pool for XNF stakers. When a user engages in a token swap on Xenify, they are charged a swap fee that amounts to 0.5% of the total swap value. This fee serves a dual purpose: it rewards the XNF stakers for their involvement and investment in the ecosystem, and it supports the ongoing growth and development of the protocol.

The collected 0.5% swap fee is partitioned in a way that promotes balance and incentivization within the ecosystem. Half of the fee, or 0.25%, is distributed to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens, rewarding them for their active participation. The remaining 0.25% is allocated to the Xenify team to fund ongoing operational costs, such as platform development, marketing initiatives, and community outreach efforts.

By paying the swap fee, users not only facilitate their transaction but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle, providing an added benefit for their engagement with the protocol. The portion of the fee dedicated to the team plays a vital role in promoting and enhancing the Xenify platform and the associated tokens (XEN, DXN, xYSL, and XNF). This ensures heightened awareness and adoption, contributing to the overall growth and success of the Xenify protocol.

## ◽️ Costs of Burning DXN and xYSL

Participating in the burning process of DXN or xYSL tokens on the Xenify protocol incurs certain costs, including transaction gas fees and a mandatory burn fee. The burn fee structure is designed to offer users discounts based on the number of batches they burn, incentivizing larger burns. The more batches you burn, the greater your discount, which can reach up to 50% off for 10,000 batches. The burn fee is determined using this formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

- $BF$ - Burn fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GS$ - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - The constant 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

<br>

A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either DXN or xYSL, set aside for burning. This setup ensures a clear and consistent method for token burning, simplifying the process for users.

To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have at least the Number of Batches multiplied by a fixed number of tokens in their wallet, depending on the token type being burned. The burn fee is directed towards the rewards pool, benefiting XNF token holders based on their stake in XNF. The fee calculation is designed to provide a discount based on the volume of a specific token (DXN or xYSL) a user burns, with the maximum discount being 50% for 10,000 batches.

In summary, the burn fee calculation sets the fees a user incurs when they execute a burn operation on Xenify. The fee is determined by multiplying the gas spent on the operation by a factor that accounts for the number of batches being burned. This factor is computed by subtracting the product of the number of batches and 0.00005 from 1, which is then multiplied by the number of batches.

This fee structure encourages users to perform larger burn operations by providing them with progressively lower fees as they increase the number of batches being burned. This approach encourages efficiency and incentivizes users to contribute to the platform, while simultaneously benefiting from reduced fees for larger transactions.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

The protocol establishes a balanced approach for the distribution of XNF tokens. It carefully considers two crucial aspects: the user's active participation in the token burn cycle, and the swap fees they've incurred during the cycle. Both elements are granted equal significance, each accounting for 50% of the total distribution. The user's contribution to the burn cycle is calculated using the following formula:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

In this formula, the total quantity of XNF tokens designated for distribution during a cycle (for instance, 20,000 XNF tokens) is halved and then divided by the sum of batches burned by all participants in that cycle. This results in a value per batch burned. The user's individual contribution is then determined by multiplying this batch value by the number of batches they have specifically burned within that cycle. The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.

<br>

In the swap contribution formula, half of the total cycle distribution is proportionally divided based on the sum total of swap fees contributed by all users in the cycle. This process generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid. The individual user's swap contribution is then determined by multiplying this derived value by the amount of swap fees that the user has individually contributed during the cycle.

The protocol merges the calculated burn contribution and swap contribution to accurately determine the total XNF distribution each user should receive. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

## ◽️ Staking XNF Tokens

Xenify protocol automatically stakes any uncollected XNF tokens, allowing XNF stakers to earn native chain rewards. Users can enhance their rewards by staking collected or unstaked XNF tokens back into the protocol. Both unclaimed and staked XNF tokens contribute to earning native chain rewards, with each user's share determined by their portion of the native chain reward pool.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Equity

At the end of each cycle, the earned equity becomes available for collection. Users have the option to collect their XNF rewards from previous cycles, but this is not mandatory. Users may choose to leave their equity staked to optimize native chain rewards or collect it for trading.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

Once XNF tokens are staked, they remain locked for the duration of the next cycle, whether it's a gap cycle or not, and begin accruing fees if DXN or xYSL tokens are burned. After the cycle ends, users can choose to unstake their tokens and reclaim ownership.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Token Rewards

Just like collecting equity, users can claim their accumulated native token rewards by withdrawing all previously earned native tokens. This feature allows users to easily access and manage their rewards, demonstrating Xenify's commitment to a user-friendly experience.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

Each cycle has a pool of accumulated native token rewards, which build up as burnBatch transactions are executed. These fees are distributed per cycle based on the number of locked XNF tokens a user has in the protocol (which includes unclaimed XNF and staked XNF), plus the number of XNF tokens earned from burning DXN or xYSL in that cycle.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To ensure a smooth and successful start for Xenify, a special liquidity provisioning event will take place during the launch. The distribution of XNF tokens will be adjusted to meet the platform's liquidity needs and support its users across all chains. This well-planned launch guarantees sufficient liquidity is created on each chain, providing a strong foundation for the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: Burn and Liquidity Allocation

On the first day of the event, 20,000 XNF tokens will be allocated. Of these tokens, 10,000 XNF will be designated for liquidity provisioning, to be used for protocol-owned liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF will be made available for the burning, allowing users to participate in a fair and decentralized token distribution. The native chain rewards generated on Day 1 will be utilized for liquidity pairing, with the corresponding LP tokens being burned to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability. The initial price of XNF tokens will be based on the amount of native tokens received against the 10,000 XNF. 

#### ▫️ The formula for the initial price is:

<br>

$$
IP = NT \div TXT
$$

**Where:**

- $IP$ - Initial Price
- $NT$ - Total Value of Native Tokens Collected
- $TXT$ - Total XNF Tokens (10,000)

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution

Starting from Day 2, the distribution of XNF tokens will return to its regular schedule, with 10,000 XNF allocated for the burning of DXN and xYSL tokens and another 10,000 XNF designated for swap volume. This balanced distribution model will continue to incentivize users to actively engage with the protocol, contributing to its growth and success while maintaining a fair and sustainable token economy.

## ◽️ Amplified Burn Effect

  - Holders of either Phoenix Ape NFTs or XENFT APEX NFTs will benefit from an amplified burn effect during the burn process on Xenify. This unique advantage enables NFT holders to enhance the burn effect, effectively doubling their batch burn. For example, if a user burns 1 batch, it will count as 2 batches if they possess an NFT at the time of the burn. This exclusive feature promotes unity between both communities and adds value to the NFT holders.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

  - A portion of the rental income collected as tax, combined with a share of the royalty taxes taken on OpenSea, will be distributed to all Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain as claimable USDC rewards at the end of each 8-hour epoch. However, it is important to note that if the NFT is bridged to another chain to amplify the burns, the holder will not be part of the USDC distribution. The claimable USDC rewards are exclusively for addresses holding the Phoenix Ape NFT on the BNB Chain.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unique Rental Mechanism
  
  - The Phoenix Ape NFT introduces a one-of-a-kind rental mechanism, allowing you to lease your NFT at a predetermined USDC price for a specific duration while it stays on the BNB Chain. This innovative feature plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the USDy token. By renting out your Phoenix Ape NFT, you contribute to the generation of LP tokens that are utilised in the USDy Incentive Buyback (UIB) mechanism, promoting the token's overall stability and health within the ecosystem. Moreover, Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain receive a portion of the rental tax, further rewarding their participation and investment in holding this exclusive NFT.
