# ◽️ XEN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

XEN is a project that was launched on the principles of self-custody, trustless consensus, and decentralisation. It is a joint effort of several blockchain enthusiasts who aim to create a fairer, more transparent mining ecosystem.

One of the main goals of XEN is to democratise mining by providing a decentralised platform that allows anyone to participate in the mining process. This is achieved by utilising a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm that is resistant to ASIC mining, thus ensuring that the network remains accessible to individual miners.

In addition to its mining capabilities, XEN also features a native cryptocurrency, the XEN token, which is used to incentivise miners and maintain the security of the network. XEN tokens are also used to pay for transaction fees and other network services.

XEN operates on a Proof of Participation (PoP) system, which allows participants to mint their coins. The XEN smart contract employs a fair distribution system based on reward time locks and the total number of participants. XEN's value is linked to its difficulty to be minted, similar to Bitcoin. As more participants join and mint XEN, the total amount of generated XEN drops, making it more scarce and valuable.

One of the key features of XEN is its simplicity, as it is based on the ERC20 token standard with minimal code, no pre-minting, hidden doors, admin keys, or origin wallets. Furthermore, XEN has a supply of zero and can only be minted by the participating community. This makes it inflationary at the beginning and disinflationary as adoption increases. XEN is immutable and has no backing by investors or intrinsic value.

To mint XEN, participants can connect their Ethereum-compatible wallets to the XEN smart contract and specify the number of days they are willing to wait to receive XEN. The smart contract generates a XEN rank (cRANK) based on how many people interacted with the contract before the participant. Participants can also stake XEN for 1 to 1,000 days, with APY rewards starting at 20% on XEN Genesis and decreasing by 1 percentage point every 90 days until it reaches 2%, where it will remain indefinitely.

Overall, XEN represents an innovative approach to mining that emphasises decentralisation, accessibility, and sustainability. XEN's combination of features, simplicity and fairness make it a unique and promising project in the crypto space.

# ◽️ USDy Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

USDy is a reward token that incentivizes participation in the YSL.IO ecosystem with stability and sustainability at its core. Developed with cutting-edge tokenomincs, the YSL.IO protocol boasts a host of innovative features that make USDy a standout reward token in the DeFi landscape.

One of the key highlights of USDy is its Price Stability Model (PSM), which ensures a continuous increase in liquidity, even in the face of sell pressure. The protocol achieves this through a combination of autonomous Treasury-Owned Liquidity creation and an ingenious Buyback and Burn feature (UBB), which actively works to stabilise the price of USDy.

Here's how it works: the UBB is activated every 4-epochs if the USDy pool price falls below $0.95. During this time, a portion of the tax from every trade of YSL, xYSL, bYSL, and USDy will be used to purchase and/or burn USDy. Additionally, 15% of every HydraVault deposit will also be used to purchase and burn USDy.

What's more, the protocol generates Treasury-Owned Liquidity for USDy at every point of user interaction, ensuring that as more users join the YSL.IO ecosystem, USDy's liquidity grows autonomously. And to further reduce the supply of USDy and increase its price, the Incentive Buyback mechanism (UIB) kicks in every time someone purchases the YSL token using ChainZap. This mechanism incorporates a 25% incentive to purchase YSL while actively reducing the supply of USDy.

Here's how it works: all of the USDC sent will be used to purchase and burn USDy equivalent to 175%, and as a bonus, users receive a complimentary 25% USDy for each purchase. The result is a reduction in USDy supply and an increase in its price, benefiting USDy holders.

In conclusion, USDy has been carefully crafted by YSL.IO with a focus on price stability, and liquidity growth. With innovative features like UBB and UIB, USDy liquidity will continue to grow autonomously while its price remains stable, creating a sustainable, less volatile, and more robust ecosystem.

# ◽️ Xenify Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

Xenify is not just an aggregator of aggregators, but a cross-chain aggregator of aggregators! Designed to simplify the swapping process for users navigating multiple chains, Xenify's capabilities are truly unmatched. With the power of ChainZap, an advanced liquidity aggregation protocol, Xenify connects to 19 different aggregators, providing extraordinary liquidity and unbeatable rates across 32 leading chains. Swapping tokens between Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and many more has never been easier.

Picture this: a user wants to swap Token-A on Ethereum for Token-B on BNB Chain. With Xenify, the swap is executed with a single click and a single transaction on Ethereum. No more complex chain navigation or price hunting – Xenify takes care of it all, delivering the best available rates.

But wait, there's more! Xenify is not just a platform for cross-chain swaps; it's a thoughtfully designed ecosystem with distinct tokenomics, utilising swap and burn fee mechanisms to benefit all participants. The optional 0.5% swap fee, which users can opt to pay when making a swap, not only fuels Xenify's competitive edge but also rewards Xenify users and XNF stakers. Talk about a win-win! 

Here’s how it works: When users opt to pay the swap fee, they not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. From the swap fee, 50% is sent to support the team in funding future audits, development, and marketing efforts, while the remaining 50% is sent as native chain rewards to staked XNF holders on supported chains. That's right – XNF stakers can benefit from every swap on supported chains! 

Moreover, Xenify's design integrates an ingenious burn mechanism that enables users to burn XEN and USDy tokens to mint XNF, positioning the XEN burning process as a strategic layer 2 burner of XEN. But here’s the best part, a whopping 100% of burn fees are channelled back to XNF stakers. 

Xenify's built-in swap and burn fee mechanisms help create a reciprocal environment that rewards platform users with XNF as part of the daily reward cycle, and XNF stakers with a generous 100% of burn fees and 50% of swap fees across all supported chains. The team's portion of the swap fee is instrumental in promoting and enhancing the Xenify platform and its associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF), ensuring increased awareness and adoption. This strategy not only fosters user engagement, but also amplifies rewards for those deeply involved with the protocol.

With Xenify, users can effortlessly execute cross-chain token swaps through seamless integration with numerous aggregators and chains, while reaping the benefits of the best rates and having the opportunity to earn XNF. This cultivates a vibrant ecosystem that sparks user participation and nurtures a community-driven environment. Xenify's innovative approach, paired with its unique tokenomics model, guarantees that the platform will remain ahead of the curve, attract a growing user base, and contribute to the project's overall success.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify's total supply of XNF tokens is capped at 21.5 million, and strategically divided into three core segments. The allocation comprises 10,500,000 XNF tokens designated for direct burns of XEN and USDy, an additional 10,500,000 XNF tokens reserved for swap volume, and a separate 500,000 XNF tokens earmarked for the launch airdrop.

Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, Xenify's distribution model adopts the halving principle.  As demonstrated in the graph below, following the 8th halving, Xenify's daily distribution rate stabilises, ensuring a consistent output of 156.25 XNF tokens per day until the maximum supply is reached in month 2112.

With Xenify's halving model applying equally to both direct burns and swap volume distributions, it guarantees a fair distribution of the daily reward pool among active users. This can be in the form of burning tokens to acquire XNF or by utilising Xenify on supported chains to execute swaps. This distinctive strategy has been thoughtfully engineered to ensure an equitable supply distribution centred around users' active participation, underscoring Xenify's steadfast dedication to fostering an equitable and engaged community.

## ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

The minting process for XNF has been structured to reward users who actively contribute to Xenify's growth through various activities. This approach promotes an equitable distribution of XNF tokens, cultivating a truly decentralised and community-driven protocol.

Similarly, Xenify's incentive structure has been meticulously crafted to motivate users to actively participate in the protocol's growth. Users who engage more with the platform receive a proportionate share of the newly minted XNF tokens, fueling further involvement.

XNF tokens are distributed in one-day cycles, with the reward pool commencing at 20,000 XNF tokens. This initial allocation is divided into two categories: 50% is designated for users who burn XEN or USDy tokens, while the remaining half is reserved for those contributing through the platform's swap fee.

With the halving model in place, the daily reward pool diminishes over time and ultimately leads to the complete distribution of the 21.5 million XNF tokens at month 2112. Users that stake XNF tokens will accumulate native token rewards that are generated from swap fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC). In addition, stakers will also benefit from the burn fees collected from XEN or USDy burns performed on the Xenify platform. 

This innovative three-pronged incentive model not only helps generate swap volume with users seeking to earn XNF but also rewards user participation through burning and staking. Ultimately, this approach fosters platform growth and cultivates a thriving, engaged user base.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Burn to earn XNF 
  - The Xenify platform empowers its users by providing the ability to burn XEN and USDy tokens, resulting in the minting of XNF. This positions Xenify as a key player in the strategic layer 1 burning of XEN tokens. The approach adopted by Xenify goes beyond simply reducing the circulating supply of XEN and USDy tokens. It aims to unify the XEN and YSL.IO ecosystems, while also strategically integrating both communities under a shared vision.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Swap to earn XNF 
  - Xenify is a pioneering cross-chain aggregator of aggregators that transforms the way users experience token exchanges.  With its seamless single-click transactions and the opportunity to earn XNF tokens, Xenify sets itself apart from the competition.

  - By swapping with Xenify and choosing to pay the swap fee, users actively contribute to the platform's growth. The 0.5% swap fee is divided, with half being distributed as rewards to XNF stakers, celebrating those who fully engage with the protocol. The remaining portion of the fee is utilised by the team to promote and enhance the Xenify platform and its associated tokens (XEN, USDy, and XNF), ensuring increased awareness and adoption.

  - What truly sets Xenify apart from other platforms is the added benefit users receive when opting to pay the swap fee. Users can increase their XNF holdings through daily XNF token distributions, making Xenify a rewarding experience. Users not only enjoy a seamless cross-chain token swapping experience but also earn XNF in the process.

  - The XNF rewards can either be collected by the user or staked to earn even more from the native tokens generated from swap and burn fees. As a result, users benefit from the efficiency and competitive rates offered by Xenify while earning rewards and  actively participating in shaping the future of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

### ♦️ Stake XNF to earn native tokens 
  - Setting itself apart from generic aggregators, Xenify boasts a unique burn and swap fee distribution mechanism. This will empower platform users to not only execute seamless swaps but to also embark on a rewarding journey by staking the XNF tokens acquired from daily distributions. 

  - XNF token stakers play an essential role in Xenify's long-term growth, and in return reap the benefits of a proportionate share of burn and swap fees generated across all supported chains. As Xenify continues to broaden its reach, an increasing amount of swap volume is guaranteed, with users eager to benefit from a seamless swapping experience while earning XNF on every swap they make. This, in turn, leads to increased native chain rewards for XNF stakers! This equitable model establishes a positive feedback loop, guaranteeing that all participants can benefit from the ecosystem's growth in proportion to their engagement.

  - Here’s how it works: every day, the protocol distributes 100% of burn fees (originating from direct burns of XEN or USDy) and 50% of the platform's swap fees (generated on supported chains) to XNF stakers. These rewards are allocated in the form of native chain tokens—a highly liquid asset—signaling a potentially lucrative return for users staking XNF.

  - Xenify's innovative staking model enables users to stake their XNF tokens for an opportunity to receive a steady stream of exceptional rewards in the form of native chain rewards. This distinctive rewards distribution model not only strengthens the demand and value for XNF but also serves as an added incentive for holders to stake their daily distribution of XNF. This strategy has been integrated to encourage long-term engagement with the protocol while cultivating a growing user base.


![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Xenify offers a ground-breaking token swap solution that not only simplifies cross-chain transactions but also rewards its platform users, all the while nurturing the expansion of its ecosystem. By implementing an optional 0.5% fee on every token swap, Xenify achieves three fundamental objectives: rewarding Xenify platform users, providing native chain rewards to XNF stakers, and fortifying the continuous development of the protocol.

Here's how it works: When a user initiates a token swap on Xenify, they have the option to pay a 0.5% swap fee. This fee is strategically divided to promote future growth and incentivise user participation. A portion of 0.25% is allocated to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens, recognising their valuable contribution to the ecosystem. The remaining 0.25% is designated for the Xenify team, funding essential operational expenses such as platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement initiatives.

By choosing to pay the nominal 0.5% swap fee, users not only facilitate their transactions but also secure a position in the daily XNF reward cycle. These XNF rewards can be collected by the user or strategically staked to unlock even greater gains from the native tokens generated through swap and burn fees. Consequently, users enjoy the benefits of Xenify's efficiency and competitive rates, all while reaping rewards and actively shaping the evolution of Xenify's dynamic ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning XEN and USDy

The Xenify protocol enables users to engage in the burning of XEN or USDy tokens to secure XNF from the daily XNF reward cycle. By participating in this process, users will encounter specific costs such as transaction gas fees and a mandatory burn fees. However, the burn fee calculation has been meticulously designed to not only ensure a transparent and consistent method for token burning but also reward users with attractive discounts. 

The burn fee is determined using this formula:

<br>

$$
BF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

- $BF$ - Burn fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GS$ - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - The constant 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the burn fee.
- $NB$ - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in burn fees as the number of batches increases.

<br>

Our ingenious burn fee calculation takes various factors into consideration: including the gas consumed by the burn function, the number of batches, and a discount factor based on the number of batches. This powerful combination serves as a compelling incentive for users to undertake larger burn operations. And the best part? The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount they will enjoy, with potential savings of up to 50% off for 10,000 batches. But what exactly is a batch? A batch represents a fixed number of tokens, either XEN or USDy, that have been set aside for burning. 

Here’s how it works: To initiate the burn function on Xenify, users must have a wallet balance that meets or exceeds the “Number of Batches” multiplied by a fixed number of tokens, depending on the token type being burned. The protocol calculates the Burn fee by multiplying the Gas Spent (GS) by a factor that depends on the Number of Batches (NB) and the constant (CS). The more batches a user burns, the greater the discount on the burn fee. This discount is represented by the term (1 - (NB x CS)).

By implementing this calculation, we ensure that users receive discounts in proportion to the volume of a specific token (XEN or USDy) they burn. Furthermore, we are proud to emphasise that 100% of the burn fees collected are directed toward XNF stakers. This approach not only encourages efficiency but also rewards our valuable contributors, establishing a mutually beneficial ecosystem. Plus, with the maximum discount set at an impressive 50% for 10,000 batches, the more users burn, the more they save! This exciting prospect not only offers substantial benefits for users but also generates enhanced rewards for XNF stakers.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ XNF Cycle Distribution

Xenify adopts a balanced approach to reward distribution, placing equal emphasis on two essential components of the protocol: token burns and the swap fees. With both elements granted equal significance, each receives an equal allocation of the daily reward cycle distribution. For example, if the daily XNF cycle distribution is 20,000 XNF tokens, Xenify will divide the rewards, designating 10,000 XNF for burn contributions and 10,000 XNF for swap contributions.

To ascertain each user's allocation of the daily distribution of XNF tokens, the protocol will perform a series of calculations. These calculations will be based on the swap and burn contributions made during the cycle. The protocol will consolidate these contributions to accurately compute the total XNF distribution for each user. This methodical approach ensures an equitable distribution, crediting both the user's active engagement in token burns and their contribution in terms of swap fees.

The protocol calculates the burn contribution (BC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total number of batches burned by all users (TBB), and the number of batches burned by the specific user (UBB). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
BC = (TCD \div 2) \times (UBB \div TBB)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *BC* - represents the burn contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *UBB* - is the number of batches a specific user has burned in a cycle.
- *TBB* - is the total number of batches burned in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the burn contribution by first dividing the total tokens distributed during a cycle (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that burn XEN or USDy. It then calculates the proportion of batches burned by the specific user (UBB) to the total batches burned by all users (TBB). This results in a value per batch burned. Finally, the protocol multiplies these two values to determine the user's individual burn contribution within that cycle (BC).

The calculation of the swap contribution follows a similar logic, whereby the protocol calculates the swap contribution (SC) of a specific user in a cycle, based on the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD), the total swap fees paid by all users (TSF), and the swap fees paid by the specific user (USF). Here's the formula explained in detail:

<br>

$$
SC = (TCD \div 2) \times (USF \div TSF)
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- *SC* - represents the swap contribution of the user.
- *TCD* - is the total amount of XNF tokens distributed in a cycle.
- *USF* - is the swap fees paid by a specific user in a cycle.
- *TSF* - is the total swap fees paid in a cycle by all users.

<br>

Here’s how it works: The protocol calculates the user's swap contribution (SC) by first dividing the total XNF tokens distributed (TCD) by 2, as half of the XNF daily reward cycle is allocated to participants that perform swaps on supported chains. It then multiplies the result by the ratio of the user's swap fees (USF) to the total swap fees (TSF) paid by all users. This generates a specific value for each unit of swap fee paid and helps in determining the proportion of XNF tokens a user receives based on their individual contribution to the swap fees in a given cycle.

## ◽️ Automatic Staking of XNF Tokens

Both unclaimed and staked XNF tokens contribute to the accrual of native chain rewards, with each user's proportion determined by their stake in the total native chain reward pool. Designed with users in mind, the Xenify protocol has been integrated with an automated staking mechanism to ensure all uncollected XNF tokens are automatically staked on behalf of the user. 

This means that holders can enjoy the benefits of accruing native chain rewards without the hassle of collecting and staking XNF tokens on each cycle. Users who prefer a hands-on approach can also stake their tokens manually. By staking already collected or unstaked XNF tokens, users have the opportunity to further boost their rewards.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Token

Upon the conclusion of each cycle, users have the opportunity to collect their allocation of the daily XNF distribution. However, collecting XNF is not mandatory as all uncollected XNF tokens are automatically staked by the protocol. This will allow users to reap the benefits of native chain rewards. On the other hand, users may decide to collect their XNF for trading purposes. Whatever the preference, Xenify offers flexibility and control for every user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

To promote a secure and efficient ecosystem, staked XNF tokens are held for two full daily cycles, even during any 'gap cycles'. After the initial cycle, staked tokens begin to accumulate native chain rewards, generated from both swap fees and burn fees. These fees are collected into a reward pool, which is then distributed by the protocol among XNF stakers. Once the two cycles have elapsed, users have the option to unstake their XNF tokens, regaining complete ownership. At this point, all earned native chain rewards are promptly delivered to the user.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Token Rewards

Xenify allows users to effortlessly claim and withdraw their accumulated native token rewards at any time. This feature has been designed to simplify reward access and management, demonstrating Xenify's dedication to creating a user-friendly experience that sets it apart from the competition.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Reward Distribution

During each cycle, the accumulation of native reward tokens unfolds, wherein the reward pool gradually accumulates tokens collected from burn and swap fees. This will continue to grow with every transaction during the cycle, be it a swap or a burn. 

As the cycle comes to an end, these rewards are carefully allocated among XNF stakers based on the total number of XNF tokens an individual has staked within the protocol. This will encompass both uncollected and staked tokens, ensuring fairness and inclusivity. With this unique reward structure, Xenify is able to strengthen the demand and value for XNF and provide a compelling incentive for holders to actively participate in the protocol. This in turn, encourages long-term engagement while cultivating a growing user base and fortifying the protocol's growth.

# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To ensure a smooth and successful start for Xenify, a special liquidity provisioning event will take place during the launch. The distribution of XNF tokens will be adjusted to meet the platform's liquidity needs and support its users across all chains. This well-planned launch guarantees sufficient liquidity is created on each chain, providing a strong foundation for the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: Burn and Liquidity Allocation

On the first day of the event, 20,000 XNF tokens will be allocated. Of these tokens, 10,000 XNF will be designated for liquidity provisioning, to be used for protocol-owned liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF will be made available for the burning, allowing users to participate in a fair and decentralized token distribution. The native chain rewards generated on Day 1 will be utilized for liquidity pairing, with the corresponding LP tokens being burned to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability. The initial price of XNF tokens will be based on the amount of native tokens received against the 10,000 XNF. 

#### ▫️ The formula for the initial price is:

<br>

$$
IP = NT \div TXT
$$

**Where:**

- $IP$ - Initial Price
- $NT$ - Total Value of Native Tokens Collected
- $TXT$ - Total XNF Tokens (10,000)

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution

Starting from Day 2, the distribution of XNF tokens will return to its regular schedule, with 10,000 XNF allocated for the burning of XEN and USDy tokens and another 10,000 XNF designated for swap volume. This balanced distribution model will continue to incentivize users to actively engage with the protocol, contributing to its growth and success while maintaining a fair and sustainable token economy.

<br>

In a bid to encourage active participation and kickstart liquidity creation, an airdrop of 500,000 XNF tokens will be conducted on Day 2. This airdrop is exclusively available to those who take part in swaps and pay the accompanying 0.5% swap fee before the deployment of the XNF contract. From this fee, 0.25% is allocated to the team to finance continual operational expenses, including platform development, marketing campaigns, and community engagement activities. The remaining 0.25% will be collected until the deployment, and then distributed as part of the first native reward distribution to users who burn either XEN or USDy tokens on Day 1. This approach not only stimulates early engagement but also helps to establish a solid liquidity pool across all the chains from the very first day.

## ◽️ Does XNF have an initial supply?
- No, Xenify does not have an initial supply or pre-mine of XNF tokens. Instead, the protocol distribute XNF tokens dynamically as users participate in the ecosystem, such as through direct burns of XEN and USDy or swapping of tokens through the Xenify aggregator. This approach ensures a fair distribution model and promotes active user involvement in the protocol.

## ◽️ Why will XNF appreciate in value?
  - Xenify's value has the potential to appreciate significantly, thanks to its groundbreaking tokenomics, thriving ecosystem, and surging demand for native chain rewards. With Xenify's state-of-the-art cross-chain aggregator, users can experience seamless token swapping and participate in various rewarding activities, driving protocol adoption and value.

  - Furthermore, the scarcity of XNF tokens, created by halving events, will likely enhance the token's value as more users embrace Xenify as their go-to place for swapping tokens. This will contribute to more native chain rewards for XNF stakers, leading to an increasing demand for the XNF tokens. As a result, the token value is likely to rise due to the demand, solidifying Xenify's place as a promising project within the XEN ecosystem.

## ◽️ How do you generate rewards with Xenify?
- Users can generate rewards with Xenify through staking their XNF equity. By doing so, they receive 100% of the burn fees and a share of the swap fees generated through the protocol. This model incentivizes long-term engagement and contributes to the protocol's growth and sustainability. As users participate actively in the ecosystem, they not only benefit from the rewards but also help shape the future of the Xenify platform.
