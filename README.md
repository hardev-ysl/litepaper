# ◽️ Tokenomics

Xenify's innovative tokenomics design prioritizes a fair and sustainable distribution model that rewards user engagement within its ecosystem. The XNF token, with a total supply of 21 million, serves as the primary reward for users participating in various platform activities such as burning, swapping, and interacting with the Xenify ecosystem.

### ◽️ Token Supply and Distribution

The XNF token serves as a reward for users engaging with the Xenify platform. With a total supply of 21 million XNF tokens, the distribution is conducted through a fair launch, excluding any pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocation, or team allocations. Users can mint their XNF equity by participating in various activities on the platform, such as burning DBXEN or FENIX tokens and swapping tokens on supported chains.

### 🔶 Direct Burns
  -  Half of the total supply (10,500,000 XNF tokens) is designated for users participating in the burning of DBXEN or FENIX tokens. This distribution method employs one-day cycles and an initial reward pool of 10,000 XNF tokens. The reward pool diminishes by roughly 0.2% per cycle, with XNF token distribution dependent on users' burn participation.

### 🔶 Swap Volume
  - The other half of the total supply (10,500,000 XNF tokens) is allocated based on the swap volume generated by users on Xenify. This also adheres to a daily cycle, with rewards proportionate to users' contributions to the swap volume. This strategy ensures that users are rewarded for both burning tokens and actively participating in the Xenify ecosystem.

### 🔶 Deployed Chains

XNF will be deployed onto the following chains:

- Ethereum
- BNB Chain
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Moonbeam
- Fantom
- OKChain
- Evmos

### ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

Xenify's minting process is designed to provide dynamic rewards to users who actively participate in various platform activities, thereby contributing to the growth of the ecosystem. The incentive structure is tailored to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of XNF tokens, promoting a decentralized and community-driven platform. The platform activities that users can engage in include burning, swapping, and other platform-specific functions.

The incentive structure of Xenify is designed to encourage users to actively participate in the platform's growth, thus driving value and fostering a thriving, decentralized ecosystem. As users engage more with Xenify, they receive a share of the newly minted XNF tokens based on their participation level, which in turn motivates users to contribute even more to the platform's success. XNF tokens are distributed through one-day cycles, starting with a reward pool of 10,000 XNF tokens. These tokens are allocated specifically to those who burn DBXEN or FENIX tokens.

The 10,000 XNF tokens are distributed evenly among the two token types, with 5,000 allocated to DBXEN burns and 5,000 to FENIX burns. This distribution structure ensures that users participating in the burning of different tokens are rewarded accordingly. By providing incentives for users to engage with the platform and burn tokens, Xenify encourages a thriving, community-driven ecosystem that benefits all participants.

The reward pool decreases by approximately 0.2% per cycle, leading to the full unlocking of nearly 21 million XNF tokens after about 62 years of continuous protocol usage. Staked XNF tokens accumulate native token fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.) from new DBXEN or FENIX burns or swap fees generated on the Xenify platform across supported chains. This design incentivizes user participation, helping maintain platform growth, and fostering a thriving, community-driven environment.

### ♦️ Burning 
  - Users can participate in burning DBXEN or FENIX tokens, which are directly tied to the Xenify ecosystem. By burning these tokens, users contribute to the platform's growth and deflationary tokenomics. In return, they are rewarded with XNF tokens based on their level of engagement in the burning process.

### ♦️ Swapping 
  - Users can exchange tokens on the Xenify platform, benefiting from the aggregated trading volume across multiple aggregators. As a cross-chain aggregator of aggregators, Xenify does not rely on its own liquidity pool but instead sources liquidity from various aggregators. The more users swap, the more they contribute to the platform's growth, and the greater their potential rewards in XNF tokens.

### ♦️ Staking 
  - Users can stake their XNF tokens to earn a share of the protocol fees and swap fees generated within the platform. By staking their tokens, users not only secure the platform's network but also contribute to its growth. In return, they receive a portion of the protocol fees from burning activities and the swap fees generated on supported chains as native token rewards. This incentivizes users to continue participating in the Xenify ecosystem and hold their XNF tokens.

### ◽️ Staking, Rewards, and Fees

Xenify's staking model allows users to stake XNF tokens and earn a share of protocol fees generated from direct burns of DBXEN or FENIX. Staking rewards are paid out in ETH, providing users with a valuable and liquid asset as a return on their investment.

In addition to protocol fees, Xenify distributes a portion of the platform's swap fees to its stakers. 50% of these swap fees are allocated as ETH rewards to users who stake XNF tokens, ensuring a continuous income stream for stakers. The remaining 50% of swap fees are used to support the token price and further reward stakers, contributing to a sustainable token value and incentivizing long-term platform engagement.

Transaction fees on Xenify play a vital role in fostering a healthy ecosystem, as they are fully utilized to support the token price and reward stakers. This approach helps maintain platform growth, incentivizes user participation, and promotes a thriving, community-driven environment. By offering various incentives to stakeholders, Xenify aims to create a robust ecosystem that benefits all participants and encourages sustained growth.

### ◽️ Costs of Burning DBXen and FENIX

In order to burn DBXen, or FENIX on the Xenify platform, users must pay the transaction gas fee and an additional mandatory Protocol fee. The Protocol fee is calculated as follows:

<br>

$$
Protocol fee = Gas Spent * (1 - 0.00005 * Number of Batches) * Number of Batches
$$

<br>

A batch is a fixed number of tokens to burn, depending on the token being burned (DBXen or FENIX).

For example, on Ethereum:

- 1 batch = [Fixed Number] FENIX tokens
- 1 batch = [Fixed Number] DBXen tokens

To execute the burn function on the Xenify Protocol, users need to have at least the Number of Batches * [Fixed Number of Tokens] in their wallet, depending on the token being burned. The Protocol fee is directed towards the reward pool, from which XNF token holders are rewarded based on their accrued XNF. The fee calculation is designed to apply a discount based on the amount of a specific token (DBXen or FENIX) the user burns, with the maximum discount being 50% for 10,000 batches (the larger the number of batches, the bigger the discount).

In essence, the Protocol fee calculation determines the fees charged from a user when they perform a burn operation on the Xenify Protocol. The fee is calculated by multiplying the gas spent on the operation by a factor that takes into account the number of batches being burned. This factor is calculated by subtracting the product of the number of batches and 0.00005 from 1, which is then multiplied by the number of batches.

By structuring the fee calculation this way, Xenify encourages users to perform larger, more efficient burn operations by gradually charging them lower fees as they increase the number of batches being burned. This system promotes efficiency and incentivizes users to contribute to the platform while enjoying the benefits of reduced fees for larger transactions.

Notations:

- **PF** - Protocol fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- **GS** - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- **NB** - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in protocol fees as the number of batches increases.

The constant 0.00005 is used to factor in the discount on the protocol fee.

### ◽️ Reward Cycle Distribution

The "User Reward/Cycle" formula calculates the rewards percentage that a specific user is entitled to receive for their contribution to a burn cycle. The calculation is performed by multiplying the total cycle reward amount by the number of batches the user has burned in that specific cycle and then dividing it by the total number of batches burned in that cycle by all users. This calculation ensures fair and proportionate distribution of rewards to all participants based on their burn contribution.

**Where:**

- **URC (User Reward/Cycle):** The reward earned by a specific user in a particular cycle.
- **TCR (Total Cycle Reward):** The total amount of rewards distributed among all users in a particular cycle.
- **UBN (User Batch Number):** The total number of batches a specific user has burned during the cycle.
- **TBN (Total Batch Number):** The total number of batches burned by all users during the cycle.

The XNF rewards are calculated based on the gas consumed from burning DBXEN or FENIX. This represents the computational expense of executing the transaction.

After the cycle ends, the reward calculated per user for a specific cycle is given by the total amount of gas consumed divided by the amount of gas consumed by a specific user. Rewards are claimable only after the corresponding cycle ends.

### ◽️ Native Token Fee Distribution

Each cycle has its own pool of accrued native token fees that accumulate while burnBatch transactions are executed. Per cycle, these are distributed based on how many locked XNF tokens a user has inside the protocol (locked - unclaimed XNF + staked XNF) added with how many XNF tokens were gained from burning DBXEN or FENIX in the corresponding cycle.

### ◽️ Claiming Rewards (XNF)

Once a cycle ends, the rewards associated with it are ready to be claimed. A user claiming their rewards will be granted the entire amount of XNF tokens earned in all previous cycles.

### ◽️ Claiming Native Token Fees (native token of blockchain)

Similar to claiming rewards, a user wishing to claim their accumulated fees will withdraw all the native tokens obtained beforehand.

### ◽️ Staking XNF tokens

Unclaimed XNF tokens are considered as staked within the protocol. Claimed or unstaked XNF needs to be staked back into the protocol in order to generate the respective rewards. Unclaimed+Staked XNF will generate passive income in the blockchain's native token based on the share from the reward pool entitled to each respective user.

### ◽️ Unstaking XNF tokens

The staked XNF tokens that have reached the cycle in which they are unlocked can be unstaked, returning them to the user's possession.

# ◽️ Security

Xenify places great importance on security and governance to ensure the safety and reliability of the platform. The token contract is a fork from DBXen, with minor changes, and has been audited by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm. To further bolster the platform's security, Xenify plans to have the contract re-audited by Peckshield, another well-respected security company in the industry.

Xenify is designed with decentralization and autonomy in mind. The smart contracts do not have admin keys, which means that they cannot be upgraded or controlled by a centralized authority. This structure ensures that the platform remains truly decentralized and autonomous, with no decision-making power held by any single party. As Xenify evolves, it will continue to prioritize the interests of its users, promoting transparency and trust throughout the platform.

Xenify aims to create a transparent, equitable, and user-centric DeFi platform by adhering to the following principles. By adhering to these principles, Xenify aims to build a DeFi platform that fosters trust, equity, and community-driven growth in the DeFi space:
