Welcome to Xenify, a groundbreaking protocol that synergistically combines DBXen's innovative tokenomics with ChainZap's powerful functionality to revolutionize the DeFi landscape. Xenify, with a total supply of 21,000,000 XNF tokens, allows users to obtain XNF by burning DXN or xYSL tokens while simultaneously acting as a layer 2 burner of XEN. The primary objective of Xenify is to establish a seamless and efficient cross-chain swapping protocol that rewards users with native chain rewards and a capped supply token.

At the heart of Xenify's vision lies ChainZap, a cutting-edge liquidity aggregation protocol that streamlines cross-chain token swaps. By connecting to 19 different aggregators across leading chains, such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum, Xenify guarantees unparalleled liquidity and optimal rates for users. Utilizing advanced APIs, Xenify ensures smooth communication with various DEX aggregators, significantly enhancing user swapping experiences and simplifying the process of identifying the best swap routes across multiple chains.

Xenify's inbuilt swap fee and protocol fee allocation mechanisms create a mutually beneficial environment for all participants. Staked XNF holders receive an impressive 50% of swap fees as native chain rewards on all supported chains, while the remaining 50% supports Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach initiatives. This strategic allocation is crucial for raising awareness, driving adoption, and fostering long-term growth and sustainability for the protocol, benefiting both users and the protocol itself.

Furthermore, Xenify's unique design ensures that 100% of the protocol fees generated from the burning of DXN and xYSL are distributed back to XNF stakers. This approach further incentivizes user participation and enhances rewards for those actively engaged with the protocol.

Central to Xenify's commitment to fairness and transparency is its distinctive distribution model. There will be no team, founder, or investor allocations, and the only way to mint XNF tokens is through active participation in the ecosystem by burning or swapping tokens. This approach guarantees a truly equitable distribution of XNF tokens, rewarding users for their contributions and nurturing a community-driven platform.

By fusing ChainZap's state-of-the-art liquidity aggregation with its unique tokenomics, Xenify sets the stage for a new era in cross-chain swapping. With these innovative allocation mechanisms, Xenify cultivates a thriving ecosystem that prioritizes user satisfaction and long-term success, while continuously supporting the protocol's growth and development.

# ◽️ DXN Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

## ◽️ Total Supply: 5,010,000

DBXen (DXN) is a groundbreaking digital asset within the XEN ecosystem that contributes to $XEN deflation while providing users with new value creation opportunities. The project's primary objective is to ensure a fair and equitable token distribution through a community-driven approach, fostering a decentralized and transparent ecosystem.

The deflationary mechanism of DXN is one of its key features. As a capped token, DXN can only be minted through the burning of XEN tokens, reducing their total supply and addressing inflation concerns. Furthermore, DXN tokens serve as an income stream for stakers, who receive native chain rewards until the entire DXN supply is distributed over approximately 62 years.

DBXen protocol's commitment to a fair launch eliminates pre-mines, treasury allocations, and private/public sales, ensuring equal distribution for all users. This approach, coupled with the pre-programmed token distribution algorithm, guarantees transparency and fairness, as it cannot be altered or reverted once live.

With a total supply capped at around 5.01 million, DXN tokens offer long-term stability and scarcity. The distribution process occurs in one-day cycles, starting with an initial reward pool of 10,000 DXN tokens, which decreases by approximately 0.2% per cycle, promoting a gradual distribution. Moreover, DXN tokens staked within the protocol generate native token rewards each time a new XEN burn occurs, providing an extra incentive for users to participate in the DBXen ecosystem.

In conclusion, DBXen (DXN) aspires to build a sustainable, transparent protocol that benefits the community by addressing inflation and offering staking opportunities. By leveraging the collective power of the XEN community, DBXen aims to create a more equitable, decentralized, and prosperous digital asset landscape within the XEN ecosystem. This environment empowers users to actively participate and enjoy the rewards of their involvement. With a steadfast commitment to fairness, transparency, and innovation, DBXen is set to make a lasting impact on the XEN ecosystem, contributing to its overall success.

# ◽️ xYSL Overview 
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

## ◽️ Total Supply: 80,000

xYSL is a revolutionary hyper-deflationary token engineered to create sustainable value appreciation through its unique tokenomics and autonomous algorithm. The token has been designed to increase in price and scarcity regardless of the market situation, making it an ideal investment for those seeking long-term success in the cryptocurrency space.

The core of xYSL's deflationary mechanics lies in its integration with the USDy token, the reward token of the YSL.IO ecosystem. Every time USDy is sold or transferred, the protocol uses 10% of the USDy transaction to buy xYSL from the market, which is then immediately burned and sent to a dead address. This continuous supply reduction is further supported by a built-in transactional burn that sends 2.5% of every transfer or sell transaction to the dead address.

Furthermore, xYSL's positive feedback loop is bolstered by the growing trading volume of USDy as the ecosystem attracts more participants. This dynamic creates a setting in which xYSL's price continually rises while its supply decreases, making it an increasingly appealing investment opportunity. Investors looking to maximize their earnings can stake xYSL tokens in the AceVault, earning Virtue-Rewards every 8 hours. The vault's perpetual ratio feature also enhances the xYSL balance with each deposit and withdrawal, further contributing to the token's value appreciation.

In summary, xYSL introduces a novel and innovative approach to value appreciation, combining hyper-deflationary mechanics, an autonomous algorithm, and seamless integration with the USDy reward token. This distinctive design makes xYSL an exceptional opportunity for investors seeking long-term success and sustainable growth within the rapidly evolving decentralized digital asset landscape. By leveraging its unique tokenomics and features, xYSL aims to redefine the concept of value preservation and appreciation in the world of cryptocurrencies.

![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

Xenify's innovative tokenomics design prioritizes a fair and sustainable distribution model, rewarding users for actively engaging within its ecosystem. The XNF token, capped at a total supply of 21 million, serves as the central reward for users participating in diverse platform activities, such as token burning and swapping, while interacting with the various components of the Xenify ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Token Supply

The XNF token fuels user engagement with the Xenify platform. With a total supply of 21 million XNF, its distribution follows a fair launch model, eliminating pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocation, and team allocations. Users can mint their XNF equity by participating in a variety of activities on the platform, such as burning DXN or xYSL tokens and swapping tokens on supported chains.

## ◽️ Supply Distribution

Xenify's distribution employs an exciting halving model, applying to both direct burns and swap volume distributions. From the 8th halving onwards, the daily distribution rate will maintain a minimum of 156.25 tokens/day. This approach equally divides the total daily reward pool between direct burns and swap volume, ensuring users are handsomely rewarded for both burning tokens and actively participating in the Xenify ecosystem. The halving schedule guarantees a fair distribution of rewards based on users' contributions to the platform.

To achieve this thrilling distribution, the 21 million XNF total supply is split into two equal parts: 10,500,000 XNF tokens allocated for direct burns and another 10,500,000 XNF tokens designated for swap volume. This distribution deviates from the DXN model, which has a 0.2% decrease per cycle, and instead follows the captivating halving model outlined below.

## ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

Xenify's minting process is designed to provide equity to users who actively participate in various platform activities, contributing to the growth of the ecosystem. The incentive structure ensures a fair and equitable distribution of XNF tokens, promoting a decentralised and community-driven protocol. Users can engage in activities such as burning and swapping.

The incentive structure of Xenify encourages users to actively participate in the platform's growth, driving value and fostering a thriving, decentralised ecosystem. As users engage more with Xenify, they receive a share of the newly minted XNF tokens based on their participation level, motivating them to contribute even more to the platform's success. XNF tokens are distributed through one-day cycles, starting with a reward pool of 20,000 XNF tokens.

The 20,000 XNF tokens are divided into two categories: 10,000 XNF tokens are allocated specifically to those who burn DXN or xYSL tokens, while the other 10,000 XNF tokens are reserved for users contributing to swap volume on the platform. This distribution ensures that users participating in the burning of different tokens and generating swap volume are rewarded accordingly. By providing incentives for users to engage with the platform, Xenify encourages a thriving, community-driven ecosystem that benefits all participants.

The reward pool decreases according to the halving model, leading to the distribution of nearly 21 million XNF tokens over time. Staked XNF tokens accumulate native token fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.) from new DXN or xYSL burns or swap fees generated on the Xenify platform across supported chains. This design incentivizes user participation, helping maintain platform growth and fostering a thriving, community-driven environment.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Swapping tokens on the Xenify protocol involves a swap fee, which contributes to the rewards pool for XNF token holders. When users perform a token swap on Xenify, they are required to pay a swap fee, set at 0.5% of the total swap amount. This fee is aimed at rewarding XNF stakers for their participation in the ecosystem and supporting the protocol's growth.

Of the entire 0.5% swap fee, half (0.25%) is distributed to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens as an incentive for their participation in the ecosystem. The remaining half (0.25%) goes to the team. Additionally, the swap fee grants users a position in the daily cycle of XNF rewards. The team will use the funds to support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach efforts, playing a crucial role in raising awareness and adoption of XEN, DXN, xYSL, and XNF tokens, and ensuring the platform's continued growth and success.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Costs of Burning DXN and xYSL

Engaging with the Xenify platform to burn DXN or xYSL tokens involves the transaction gas fee and an additional, mandatory Protocol fee. This unique fee structure rewards users with discounts based on the number of batches they burn. The more batches you burn, the bigger the discount - reaching up to 50% off for 10,000 batches! The Protocol fee is calculated using the following formula:

<br>

$$
PF = GS \times (1 - (NB \times CS)) \times NB
$$

<br>

- $PF$ - Protocol fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- $GS$ - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- $CS$ - The constant 0.00005, used to factor in the discount on the protocol fee.
- $NB$ - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in protocol fees as the number of batches increases.

<br>

A batch represents a fixed number of tokens designated for burning, depending on the specific token type, either DXN or xYSL. This setup ensures a straightforward and uniform method for token burning, contributing to a clear and concise understanding for litepaper readers. For example, one batch might consist of one DXN token, while another batch might include one xYSL token.

To execute the burn function on the Xenify protocol, users need to have at least the Number of Batches * [Fixed Number of Tokens] in their wallet, depending on the token being burned. The Protocol fee is directed towards the reward pool, from which XNF token holders are rewarded based on their accrued XNF. The fee calculation is designed to apply a discount based on the amount of a specific token (DXN or xYSL) the user burns, with the maximum discount being 50% for 10,000 batches (the larger the number of batches, the bigger the discount).

In essence, the Protocol fee calculation determines the fees charged from a user when they perform a burn operation on the Xenify Protocol. The fee is calculated by multiplying the gas spent on the operation by a factor that takes into account the number of batches being burned. This factor is calculated by subtracting the product of the number of batches and 0.00005 from 1, which is then multiplied by the number of batches.

By structuring the fee calculation this way, Xenify encourages users to perform larger, more efficient burn operations by gradually charging them lower fees as they increase the number of batches being burned. This system promotes efficiency and incentivizes users to contribute to the platform while enjoying the benefits of reduced fees for larger transactions.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Reward Cycle Distribution

The formula calculates the rewards percentage that a specific user is entitled to receive for their contribution to a burn cycle. The calculation is performed by multiplying the total cycle reward amount by the number of batches the user has burned in that specific cycle and then dividing it by the total number of batches burned in that cycle by all users. This calculation ensures fair and proportionate distribution of rewards to all participants based on their burn contribution.

<br>

$$
URC = TCR \times \frac{UBN}{TBN}
$$

<br>

**Where:**

- $URC$ - The reward earned by a specific user in a particular cycle.
- $TCR$ - The total amount of rewards distributed among all users in a particular cycle.
- $UBN$ - The total number of batches a specific user has burned during the cycle.
- $TBN$ - The total number of batches burned by all users during the cycle.

<br>

The XNF rewards are calculated based on the gas consumed from burning DXN or xYSL. This represents the computational expense of executing the transaction. After the cycle ends, the reward calculated per user for a specific cycle is given by the total amount of gas consumed divided by the amount of gas consumed by a specific user. Rewards are claimable only after the corresponding cycle ends.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Staking XNF Tokens

With Xenify, unclaimed XNF tokens are seamlessly staked within the protocol, generating native chain rewards for stakers. To further maximize these rewards, simply stake your collected or unstaked XNF tokens back into the protocol. Both unclaimed and staked XNF tokens work in tandem to yield native chain rewards, based on each user's share from the native chain reward pool.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Collecting XNF Equity

As each cycle comes to an end, the equity you've earned becomes available for collection. Collecting your XNF rewards from previous cycles is entirely optional and depends on your preferences. You can choose to keep your equity staked to maximize native chain rewards or collect it for trading purposes.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Unstaking XNF Tokens

The staked XNF tokens that have reached the cycle in which they are unlocked can be unstaked, returning them to the user's possession.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Claiming Native Token Fees

Similar to claiming rewards, a user wishing to claim their accumulated fees will withdraw all the native tokens obtained beforehand.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Native Token Fee Distribution

Each cycle has its own pool of accrued native token fees that accumulate while burnBatch transactions are executed. Per cycle, these are distributed based on how many locked XNF tokens a user has inside the protocol (locked - unclaimed XNF + staked XNF) added with how many XNF tokens were gained from burning DXN or xYSL in the corresponding cycle.

<br>

![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)
# ◽️ Liquidity Provisioning
![Line Divider - Filled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/233879462-b465c484-4c2f-4cd2-a126-19529e333d64.png)

<br>

To ensure a smooth and successful start for Xenify, a special liquidity provisioning event will take place during the launch. The distribution of XNF tokens will be adjusted to meet the platform's liquidity needs and support its users across all chains. This well-planned launch guarantees sufficient liquidity is created on each chain, providing a strong foundation for the ecosystem.

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 1: Burn and Liquidity Allocation

On the first day of the event, 20,000 XNF tokens will be allocated. Of these tokens, 10,000 XNF will be designated for liquidity provisioning, to be used for protocol-owned liquidity. The remaining 10,000 XNF will be made available for the burning, allowing users to participate in a fair and decentralized token distribution. The native chain rewards generated on Day 1 will be utilized for liquidity pairing, with the corresponding LP tokens being burned to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability. The initial price of XNF tokens will be based on the amount of native tokens received against the 10,000 XNF. 

#### ▫️ The formula for the initial price is:

<br>

$$
IP = NT \div TXT
$$

**Where:**

- $IP$ - Initial Price
- $NT$ - Total Value of Native Tokens Collected
- $TXT$ - Total XNF Tokens (10,000)

![Grey V4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60996729/235287926-6b18081e-ca41-48c7-8dfc-29cc32c598f1.png)

## ◽️ Day 2: Return to Normal Distribution

Starting from Day 2, the distribution of XNF tokens will return to its regular schedule, with 10,000 XNF allocated for the burning of DXN and xYSL tokens and another 10,000 XNF designated for swap volume. This balanced distribution model will continue to incentivize users to actively engage with the protocol, contributing to its growth and success while maintaining a fair and sustainable token economy.

This unique advantage enables NFT holders to enhance the burn effect, effectively doubling their batch burn. For example, if a user burns 1 batch, it will count as 2 batches if they possess an NFT at the time of the burn. This exclusive feature promotes unity between both communities and adds value to the NFT holders.

## ◽️ Claimable USDC Rewards

  - A portion of the rental income collected as tax, combined with a share of the royalty taxes taken on OpenSea, will be distributed to all Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain as claimable USDC rewards at the end of each 8-hour epoch. However, it is important to note that if the NFT is bridged to another chain to amplify the burns, the holder will not be part of the USDC distribution. The claimable USDC rewards are exclusively for addresses holding the Phoenix Ape NFT on the BNB Chain.

## ◽️ Unique Rental Mechanism
  
  - The Phoenix Ape NFT introduces a one-of-a-kind rental mechanism, allowing you to lease your NFT at a predetermined USDC price for a specific duration while it stays on the BNB Chain. This innovative feature plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the USDy token. By renting out your Phoenix Ape NFT, you contribute to the generation of LP tokens that are utilised in the USDy Incentive Buyback (UIB) mechanism, promoting the token's overall stability and health within the ecosystem. Moreover, Phoenix Ape NFT holders on the BNB Chain receive a portion of the rental tax, further rewarding their participation and investment in holding this exclusive NFT.

## ◽️ Bypassing the Sigma Exit Rate
    
  - As a Phoenix Ape NFT holder, you can benefit from the ability to sell up to 100% of any xYSL, bYSL, or USDy tokens you may possess, without being subject to the Sigma Exit Rate. This exclusive perk offers greater flexibility and control over your YSL.IO native token holdings.

Xenify places a strong emphasis on user experience, striving to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear instructions and guidance to help users navigate the platform with ease. Users can interact with the platform through various functions, such as swapping tokens across multiple blockchains, staking, and claiming rewards.

Unlike traditional decentralised exchanges, Xenify does not require users to provide liquidity. Instead, it operates as a cross-chain aggregator, utilising APIs to source the best exchange rates and lowest fees from multiple decentralised exchanges. This approach simplifies the user experience and allows for seamless transactions across different blockchain networks.

The platform provides a seamless experience for claiming rewards, staking, and unstaking tokens. Users can easily monitor their staked assets and accrued rewards, and claim or unstake their tokens with just a few clicks. This user-centric approach ensures that Xenify remains accessible to both novice and experienced users alike.

Xenify prioritises security to guarantee the safety and reliability of the protocol. The contracts from DBXen have been rigorously audited by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm. To further bolster the protocol's security, Xenify plans to schedule a re-audit of the contracts by Peckshield, another highly-regarded security company in the industry.

Xenify is thoughtfully designed with decentralisation and autonomy as its guiding principles. The smart contracts lack admin keys, meaning they cannot be upgraded or governed by a centralised authority. This structure solidifies the protocol's truly decentralised and autonomous nature, with decision-making power distributed equitably among participants. As Xenify evolves, it will continue to prioritise users' interests, fostering transparency and trust throughout the protocol.

Xenify aims to craft a transparent, equitable, and user-centric DeFi platform by adhering to the following exhilarating principles. By committing to these principles, Xenify aspires to create a DeFi platform that cultivates trust, fairness, and community-driven growth in the DeFi space.
