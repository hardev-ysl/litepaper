# ◽️ Tokenomics

Xenify's innovative tokenomics design prioritizes a fair and sustainable distribution model that rewards user engagement within its ecosystem. The XNF token, with a total supply of 21 million, serves as the primary reward for users participating in various platform activities such as burning, swapping, and interacting with the Xenify ecosystem.

### ◽️ Token Supply and Distribution

The XNF token serves as a reward for users engaging with the Xenify platform. With a total supply of 21 million XNF tokens, the distribution is conducted through a fair launch, excluding any pre-mines, investor allocations, founder allocation, or team allocations. Users can mint their XNF equity by participating in various activities on the platform, such as burning DXN or FENIX tokens and swapping tokens on supported chains.

### 🔶 Direct Burns
  -  The other half of the total supply (10,500,000 XNF tokens) is allocated based on the swap volume generated by users on Xenify. This also adheres to a daily cycle, starting with an initial XNF pool of 5,000 XNF tokens. The XNF pool for swap volume decreases by approximately 0.2% per cycle, ensuring that XNF equity is proportionate to users' contributions to the swap volume. This strategy ensures that users are rewarded for both burning tokens and actively participating in the Xenify ecosystem.

### 🔶 Swap Volume
  - The other half of the total supply (10,500,000 XNF tokens) is allocated based on the swap volume generated by users on Xenify. This also adheres to a daily cycle, starting with an initial reward pool of 5,000 XNF tokens. The XNF pool for swap volume decreases by approximately 0.2% per cycle, ensuring that rewards are proportionate to users' contributions to the swap volume. This strategy ensures that users are rewarded for both burning tokens and actively participating in the Xenify ecosystem.

### 🔶 Deployed Chains

XNF will be deployed onto the following chains:

- Ethereum
- BNB Chain
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Moonbeam
- Fantom
- OKChain
- Evmos

### ◽️ Minting Process and Incentives

Xenify's minting process is designed to provide equity to users who actively participate in various platform activities, contributing to the growth of the ecosystem. The incentive structure ensures a fair and equitable distribution of XNF tokens, promoting a decentralized and community-driven protocol. Users can engage in activities such as burning and swapping.

The incentive structure of Xenify encourages users to actively participate in the platform's growth, driving value and fostering a thriving, decentralized ecosystem. As users engage more with Xenify, they receive a share of the newly minted XNF tokens based on their participation level, motivating them to contribute even more to the platform's success. XNF tokens are distributed through one-day cycles, starting with a reward pool of 10,000 XNF tokens.

The 10,000 XNF tokens are divided into two categories: 5,000 XNF tokens are allocated specifically to those who burn DXN or FENIX tokens, while the other 5,000 XNF tokens are reserved for users contributing to swap volume on the platform. This distribution ensures that users participating in the burning of different tokens and generating swap volume are rewarded accordingly. By providing incentives for users to engage with the platform, Xenify encourages a thriving, community-driven ecosystem that benefits all participants.

The reward pool decreases by approximately 0.2% per cycle, leading to the full unlocking of nearly 21 million XNF tokens after about 122 years of continuous protocol usage. Staked XNF tokens accumulate native token fees (e.g., ETH, BNB, MATIC, etc.) from new DXN or FENIX burns or swap fees generated on the Xenify platform across supported chains. This design incentivizes user participation, helping maintain platform growth and fostering a thriving, community-driven environment.

### ♦️ Burning

By staking XNF tokens, you'll experience a continuous stream of income through native chain rewards. This generous distribution not only supports the token price but also further rewards stakers, fostering a sustainable token value and promoting long-term engagement.

  - Immerse yourself in Xenify's rewarding ecosystem, meticulously crafted to benefit all participants and nurture a thriving, community-driven environment. Embrace the opportunities that arise from engaging with this innovative platform and experience the power of a decentralized and interconnected financial future.

### ◽️ Costs of Swapping on Xenify

Swapping tokens on the Xenify protocol involves a swap fee, which contributes to the rewards pool for XNF token holders. When users perform a token swap on Xenify, they are required to pay a swap fee, set at 0.25% of the total swap amount. This fee is aimed at rewarding XNF stakers for their participation in the ecosystem.

The entire 0.25% swap fee is distributed to XNF stakers in the form of native chain tokens as an incentive for their participation in the ecosystem. Additionally, the swap fee grants stakers a position in the daily cycle of XNF rewards. The team may receive referral incentives from aggregators, which help support Xenify's ongoing development, marketing, and outreach efforts. These rewards play a crucial role in raising awareness and adoption of XEN, DXN, FENIX, and XNF tokens, ensuring the platform's continued growth and success.

### ◽️ Costs of Burning DXN and FENIX

In order to burn DXN, or FENIX on the Xenify platform, users must pay the transaction gas fee and an additional mandatory Protocol fee. The Protocol fee is calculated as follows:

<br>

$$
Protocol fee = Gas Spent * (1 - 0.00005 * Number of Batches) * Number of Batches
$$

<br>

A batch is a fixed number of tokens to burn, depending on the token being burned (DXN or FENIX).

For example, on Ethereum:

- 1 batch = [Fixed Number] DXN tokens
- 1 batch = [Fixed Number] FENIX tokens

To execute the burn function on the Xenify Protocol, users need to have at least the Number of Batches * [Fixed Number of Tokens] in their wallet, depending on the token being burned. The Protocol fee is directed towards the reward pool, from which XNF token holders are rewarded based on their accrued XNF. The fee calculation is designed to apply a discount based on the amount of a specific token (DXN or FENIX) the user burns, with the maximum discount being 50% for 10,000 batches (the larger the number of batches, the bigger the discount).

In essence, the Protocol fee calculation determines the fees charged from a user when they perform a burn operation on the Xenify Protocol. The fee is calculated by multiplying the gas spent on the operation by a factor that takes into account the number of batches being burned. This factor is calculated by subtracting the product of the number of batches and 0.00005 from 1, which is then multiplied by the number of batches.

By structuring the fee calculation this way, Xenify encourages users to perform larger, more efficient burn operations by gradually charging them lower fees as they increase the number of batches being burned. This system promotes efficiency and incentivizes users to contribute to the platform while enjoying the benefits of reduced fees for larger transactions.

Notations:

- **PF** - Protocol fee, charged for the burn function, paid in the native token of the blockchain.
- **GS** - Gas Spent, the total amount of gas consumed by the burn function to execute the code.
- **NB** - Number of Batches, the number of batches the user burns, influencing the discount in protocol fees as the number of batches increases.

The constant 0.00005 is used to factor in the discount on the protocol fee.

### ◽️ Reward Cycle Distribution

The "User Reward/Cycle" formula calculates the rewards percentage that a specific user is entitled to receive for their contribution to a burn cycle. The calculation is performed by multiplying the total cycle reward amount by the number of batches the user has burned in that specific cycle and then dividing it by the total number of batches burned in that cycle by all users. This calculation ensures fair and proportionate distribution of rewards to all participants based on their burn contribution.

**Where:**

- **URC:** The reward earned by a specific user in a particular cycle.
- **TCR:** The total amount of rewards distributed among all users in a particular cycle.
- **UBN:** The total number of batches a specific user has burned during the cycle.
- **TBN:** The total number of batches burned by all users during the cycle.

The XNF rewards are calculated based on the gas consumed from burning DXN or FENIX. This represents the computational expense of executing the transaction.

After the cycle ends, the reward calculated per user for a specific cycle is given by the total amount of gas consumed divided by the amount of gas consumed by a specific user. Rewards are claimable only after the corresponding cycle ends.

### ◽️ Native Token Fee Distribution

Each cycle has its own pool of accrued native token fees that accumulate while burnBatch transactions are executed. Per cycle, these are distributed based on how many locked XNF tokens a user has inside the protocol (locked - unclaimed XNF + staked XNF) added with how many XNF tokens were gained from burning DXN or FENIX in the corresponding cycle.

### ◽️ Claiming Rewards (XNF)

Once a cycle ends, the rewards associated with it are ready to be claimed. A user claiming their rewards will be granted the entire amount of XNF tokens earned in all previous cycles.

### ◽️ Claiming Native Token Fees

Similar to claiming rewards, a user wishing to claim their accumulated fees will withdraw all the native tokens obtained beforehand.

### ◽️ Staking XNF tokens

Unclaimed XNF tokens are considered as staked within the protocol. Claimed or unstaked XNF needs to be staked back into the protocol in order to generate the respective rewards. Unclaimed+Staked XNF will generate passive income in the blockchain's native token based on the share from the reward pool entitled to each respective user.

### ◽️ Unstaking XNF tokens

The staked XNF tokens that have reached the cycle in which they are unlocked can be unstaked, returning them to the user's possession.

# ◽️ User Experience

Xenify places a strong emphasis on user experience, striving to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear instructions and guidance to help users navigate the platform with ease. Users can interact with the platform through various functions, such as swapping tokens across multiple blockchains, staking, and claiming rewards.

Unlike traditional decentralized exchanges, Xenify does not require users to provide liquidity. Instead, it operates as a cross-chain aggregator, utilizing APIs to source the best exchange rates and lowest fees from multiple decentralized exchanges. This approach simplifies the user experience and allows for seamless transactions across different blockchain networks.

The platform provides a seamless experience for claiming rewards, staking, and unstaking tokens. Users can easily monitor their staked assets and accrued rewards, and claim or unstake their tokens with just a few clicks. This user-centric approach ensures that Xenify remains accessible to both novice and experienced users alike.

# ◽️ Security

Xenify prioritizes security to guarantee the safety and reliability of the protocol. The token contract, a fork from DBXen with minor modifications, has been audited by [Certik](https://twitter.com/CertiK), a renowned blockchain security firm.

Xenify is designed with decentralization and autonomy in mind. The smart contracts do not have admin keys, which means that they cannot be upgraded or controlled by a centralized authority. This structure ensures that the protocol remains truly decentralized and autonomous, with no decision-making power held by any single party. As Xenify evolves, it will continue to prioritize the interests of its users, promoting transparency and trust throughout the protocol.
